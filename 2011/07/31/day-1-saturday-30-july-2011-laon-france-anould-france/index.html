                  <p>Camping Costs: Lѐs Acacias €13.90 – 1 night</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We thought we’d do a long one today and head for Interlaken, try to get a day ahead. Our start wasn’t brilliant, wrong input into the GPS and after 45min of driving, we realised we were heading back along the way we drove yesterday! After stopping and re-jigging the GPS, lovingly named Hannah (Hannah Montanna, get it?!), we were back on track. But we did have to go back the way we had just come, again! This time we noticed a police car trapping, a few cars had been flashing us and now it fell into place as to why. Dan flashed a few cars to warn them, and one of the cars he flashed happened to be a police car! We all found this hilarious and had a good giggle for a few minutes. As lunch drew nearer we looked for a nice picnic spot, but couldn’t find one. Town after town went by and we couldn’t find a decent place to stop and eat. A turning that Hannah wanted us to take was closed, so we followed the recalculated route that came up on the GPS. This took us to a gravel track going into a forest. I had spotted a few parking spaces down the road and suggested we park there, have lunch and reassess how to get out of this town. The parking spaces overlooked a lovely, peaceful cemetery. Lunch with a view.We managed to navigate ourselves out of town, and were now making headway. Unfortunately the GPS said that our ETA was 19.00hrs! After a few more hours driving, we decided to stop and camp for the night. Interlaken would have to wait till tomorrow. We found a supermarket to get supplies for dinner and went in search for the nearest campsite.To Cassie’s delight, the campsite had a swimming pool AND she made a friend, someone to swim with. A lovely braai for dinner along with some local beer and wine. Ready for a nice short journey tomorrow.</p>
