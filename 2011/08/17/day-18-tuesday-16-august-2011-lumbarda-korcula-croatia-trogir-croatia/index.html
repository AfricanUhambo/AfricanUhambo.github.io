                  <h3 style="text-align:justify;">Camping Costs: Kamp Seget 191KN – 1 night</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We managed to leave early today, perhaps that was because we didn’t sleep due to the celebrations that consisted of loud music and singing. We reached Vela Luka at about 9.30hrs, purchased our tickets and went for a wonder around town. We had 4 hours to kill till the ferry. We managed to also find an exchange place that would exchange our Serbian Dinar! A relief as lots of places were simply saying no way. It was now simply a case of sitting and drinking coffee and waiting for the ferry. Oh and we are all covered in horse fly bites. We boarded the ferry and actually managed to get on first, meaning first off the ferry. We got our stuff together for the journey and made our way up to the saloon. We managed to find a table to sit at and here we stayed for the 2½ hr journey. Wendy got a little sea sick as she usually does on a ferry journey, so she wondered from occasion to help quell the sick feeling. Finally we pulled into split port and off we went. Dan was extremely excited to be first off the ferry. Off we headed for Trogir. We finally made it to Trogir and headed for the camp mentioned in the Bradt Guide. BOY! The traffic to cross the bridge into the little island Čiovo was awful…unfortunately this was where the camping was said to be so we sat in the queue. When we finally got to the campsite, they were full! We decided to carry on along the coast and see what we could find. We happened across a camp, and as it was getting late, decided to stay. Well, they put us next to the shower block where we swear fellow campers came to pooh their dogs. We assumed this as so many dog owners walked to where we were camped, stopped, stared and then walked away confused. Dan also swore blind that the place had fleas, so we deeted up, not wanting more bites. We went to take Cassie for a swim, the beach stank!! There was a motorhome toilet dump right at the entrance to the beach..you could see it as we sat and swam…disgusting!!! This was the straw that broke the camel’s back for us and so we opted to pack up early and leave. An early night, ready to skedaddle in the morning.</p>
