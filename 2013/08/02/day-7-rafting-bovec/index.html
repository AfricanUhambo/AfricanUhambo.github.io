			<p>As we said last night, we were today booked to go rafting. Cassie and I (Dan) needed to be in town for just before 1300 to get kitted up. This made for an easy start to the day, we planned to have several coffees and breakfast very slowly. After which we headed for the river again, to our secret beach. Shhh. We spent a few hours perfecting our little dam that formed a pool, we did not really swim in it though, just spent the whole time building it. I guess someone else will enjoy it after us!<!--more--></p>

<p>As we planned on walking to town, we had a very early lunch and were munching just before 12. Just as we were finishing, ready to walk into town, our German neighbour popped over to offer us a lift. He is a German from Hamburg with a deep Irish accent ... still can't get my head round it. Needless to say, this meant Cassie and I were in town with 45 minutes to kill. We made light work of this thou. We each had an ice cream, then disappeared looking for a sticker for the car. With this done, it was time to go and get kitted up. It turned out it would be us and a Czech family in the raft, once we got all the kit sorted we all jumped into the van on a short drive to the Srpenica1 launch point. What followed was around 10km of fun, which encompassed around two hours of laughs and excitement. We eventually exited at Trnovo1</p>

<p>Between the start and finish, we spent a lot of time paddling, which was broken up in the calm sections by some swimming, a stop to drink the water. We also stopped to use the raft as a slide and also for a grown up jump. The kids where not allowed as it was over 7 meters.</p>

<p>The final section of the run was very calm, so Cassie and I bailed out and floated the final section.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Cassie and I were wandering home, well, to the camp through the woods. She had an Ice Tea and chocolate, I had a Radler Beer. Very cool.</p>
