                  <p>Order of today was to relax.</p>
<p>The girls asked for a nice walk along the river, so after gathering breakfast and lunch goodies from the camp shop, we packed up and set off for a leisurely walk.</p>
<img src="https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/dscf9746.jpg">
<p>The walk took us across a few rope bridges on the Soča and Koritnica rivers, much to my dismay, with Cassie and Dan happily jumping on them to make them swing up and down. I decided that crossing once they got to the other side was a lot less stressful. At one particular bridge we came across a group of kayakers that were climbing up from the river, to the bridge, and then jumping off the bridge into the river. The whoops of joy could be heard echoing up and down the river.<!--more--></p>

<p>After a while Cassie wanted to have a swim in the river. Luckily at this point our walk ended up at the bridge near the kayak school near Čezsoča and so we decided to have lunch down by the river here and have a dip, if we were brave enough to submerse ourselves in the freezing water. I was the first to get in and get wet by simply bumbling along and falling in the water. Dan encouraged me to dive under and so I did, coming up with brain freeze! Dan was next and Cassie just ambled up and down the river playing with the rocks.</p>

<p>Dan was interested in kayaking the river, so we enquired at the kayak school about both him and Cassie going on a trip. After a chat, we decided to head up into Bovec, do some shopping and enquire at a few more places. Dan eventually booked himself and Cassie in for a 1pm rafting tour the following day.</p>

<p>Also, Cassie had managed to sleep the whole night in her own tent. Dan had promised her an ice cream sundae and so we stopped at a lovely ice cream place she has had an ice cream at before, which must be one of the last few places to have ice cream at a euro a scoop. Cassie ordered a whopper of a banana split. With the specific rule that we were allowed to let her eat the whole thing without stopping her. This we agreed to. She never did manage to finish it. Luckily Dan was around to finish up.</p>
<p>Back to camp for a dinner at the camp restaurant and a few, much need beers.</p>
