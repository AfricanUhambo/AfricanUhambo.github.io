&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After spending the night at &lt;a href=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/2012/08/23/fort-pramand-mount-pramand-overnight/&#34;&gt;Fort Pramond&lt;/a&gt;, we had a plan today to driver up to Mount Jafferau then on to a nearby Lake that is now a reservoir, we were hoping to spend the night by the river there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We managed to pack up fairly promptly and were on the way by the time the day was heating up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-0911.jpg&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125203.729&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Exit of the exciting tunnel&#34; width=&#34;368&#34; height=&#34;276&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;I was kind of excited about the day, because we were heading along a track that showed a cool tunnel on the map. I dunno how I came to that conclusion,  just by looking at the map. The tunnel on the track is circa 800 meters long, unlit, unpaved and leaks more than you would see in a normal road tunnel as it is not lined. This leak leads to a stream of water in the tunnel that is often a few inches deep. Oh and the end never seemed to appear, leading to a further sense of excitement under the dim light of the Landys head lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-1213.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125156.5093&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Fort Jafferau&#34; width=&#34;358&#34; height=&#34;268&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The other thing about the day that excited me was the climb to the Fort on Mount Jafferau, this sits at circa 2800 meters and promises spectacular views. We were not let down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Most of the track up to Jafferau is easy in a 4 x 4, I am not sure how far you&amp;#039;d want to go in a ordinary car. There are some fairly rocky sections, not hard but difficult in most cars. If the weather was bad, you would not consider it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;On the way up to Mount Jafferau, we were listening on the CB to other people that we could not see. We could hear that they were watching us, as they were mentioning the English vehicles. Even with the aid of the binoculars we could not see who was watching us and nor could we find them. It was rather creepy being in a valley, with all the ex military sites and the creepy night we had the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The track we were following stopped at Jafferau... Sort of. We had a plan to asses the situation at the end. This was because we had a map that showed a 500 meter foot path then the start of a new track down the other side of Mount Jafferau. Well when we got there we found that there was a track down, that was fairly steep and circa 1000m descent. Linking the track up and the track down was actually the easy bit. We did the whole descent in low range 1st gear, but had to occasionally slow the descent a little on top. It was great because we were following the Ski run literally, so naturally this led to us arriving at the top of the bubble lift and at the restaurant at the top of the lift. A convenient place to stop for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-1311.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125181.358&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Nice Lunch Stop&#34; width=&#34;368&#34; height=&#34;276&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Carole and Daniel had a double helping of home made Lasagne, made by the Owners Wife and Wendy and I had a local platter of meats and cheeses. After a good fill. We carried on our descent, we had about another thousand meters to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We headed down towards Bardonecchia to pick up the track to take us up to the Lake for the next night. Unfortunately we found the/a track but could not find our way onto the one we wanted that led to the lake. We ended up back tracking and taking a scenic road that met up with the track we needed. The track was really easy and fairly pleasant if busy. You could have done this section in a car. Apart from going to the actual camping spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-1546.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125152.4119&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;Valley of Lago di Rochemolles &#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;107&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The road continues on from where we camped to one of the highest glaciers you can drive to in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-1702.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125163.2832&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;Refreshing Bath&#34; width=&#34;341&#34; height=&#34;256&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We stopped for the evening at the river that feeds Lago di Rochemolles, it was obviously icy cold, but was great for a very invigorating bath and cooling some Prosecco. The valley was very scenic and a great stop for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-1704.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125195.692&#34; class=&#34;alignnone&#34; alt=&#34;Cutting Wood&#34; width=&#34;351&#34; height=&#34;263&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;That night we had a proper fire in a pit made by some predecessors, we managed to find enough wood nearby and an old sauce pan to warm water for washing up. Dinner that night was slightly left field. We had failed to stop for more supplies since our last supermarket stop, we had some powdered soup from Croatia. This was very nice, I think it was called Dalmation soup.... We also had three military ration packs, which had been given to us by John in Cinque terra. Our plan was to enjoy these as pudding after we had the roast potatoes. Unfortunately being military ration novices what we cooked for pudding was awful. I feel for the boys who eat them, this looked off. So we ended up going to bed a bit hungry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Update: I have since learnt that the packs last for 10 years. Sorry John. If you are reading this John, we lost your email address, hope you had a cool trip. It was great having a BBQ with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-2043.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125179.4502&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Girls Washing up.&#34; width=&#34;310&#34; height=&#34;233&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Camping by a stream led to a lot of night time pees. In the morning we woke stinking of smoke. Had breakfast and headed for the road. It was here, well in Bardonecchia we would say bye for a few days to Carole and Daniel. Obviously we did this over coffee and pastries. They were heading to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-17021.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125165.5713&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;Our Spot&#34; width=&#34;363&#34; height=&#34;272&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We from hear ambled our way via a few one night stops home, as usual once we got half way up France the heavens opened and we just headed back to the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lafayette Venus CB Radio Install</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-9-jun-2012-2011.jpg?w=225&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; alt=&#34;CB Antenna Mounting Location on the back of the Defender&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been meaning to install a CB radio for several years, I finally got round to it this year. On the last few trips, we have found that we could have done with a CB to communicate with others in the group at various stages. It is not always possible to depend on mobile phones for short range and duration communications. Apart from the issues and expense of roaming outside UK, the connection time is too long and the likelihood of a reliable signal is low when in a remote location.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been looking at various models of CB for a while, I wanted a euro compatible model as I would most likely use the CB abroad more than in the UK. This would allow me to switch the frequency range to suit which ever country we are visiting. The other important requirement was a unit that would take up little room in the Defender cab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the suppliers had pretty much the same range of products, prices did vary slightly. All seemed to do various kits or packages. I was not after a sophisticated CB as long as it covered the Euro zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-6-jun-2012-2016.jpg?w=300&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;198&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much browsing and looking at reviews, I narrowed my choice down to two. These are the Intek M-100 Plus and the Lafayette Venus. Both are small units, the Intek is narrow at 100mm wide and about 37mm high, but has made up for its slender face by being slightly long at about 200mm including the rear plug and front knobs. The Intek has the a fairly conventional layout with a simple handset and the main unit housing the controls and display. The Venus CB unit is also slender at 108mm wide, 29mm high and 136mm deep. The big difference of the Venus from the Intek is that the layout is not that conventional. It has a plain base unit, with a fairly complex handset that houses the display and all the controls. This gives the Venus a fairly complex look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-9-jun-2012-20117.jpg?w=224&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; width=&#34;224&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-9-jun-2012-20111.jpg?w=224&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;224&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of the Venus layout is the base unit is discreet. This is the main attraction to me. In many countries CB is illegal or at least frowned upon. So in the case of the Venus, I can simple disconnect the handset and stow it out of sight and also unscrew the antenna from the rear of the vehicle. This will mean that it should not be noticed that we have a CB at any borders. I can go one step further also. The unit has a power connector so to completely remove the base unit it is simply a matter of disconnecting power and antenna plugs, these stow being the fuse panel in the Defender out of sight and the base unit can be hidden anywhere. In the picture on the right you can see how the cables would be stowed behind the cover to the left of the CB unit. I had considered mounting the module under the cubby box or inside the cubby box, but in the end I decided against it for amongst other reasons heat dissipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-6-jun-2012-2024.jpg?w=300&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;269&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in the strange situation this year, that I actually am travelling with people from the outset and needed to source a CB for them also. This gave rise to the opportunity to buy both the Intek and the Lafayette. The Intek should be good for their use as it is easy to stow and use in an adhoc manner thanks to the 12 volt plug that is fitted. This gives the opportunity to test both radios for a month on the road. If the Venus turns out to be a dog, then I&amp;#039;ll swap for the Intek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-6-jun-2012-2034.jpg?w=180&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I would mount the antenna to the rear of the vehicle with a body mount. This position allows the antenna to be mounted high, which should aid the range of the CB, it also proved fairly easy to get a decent SWR reading, though out both the UK and Euro bands I get a maximum reading of Circa 1.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may have to review this antenna location once we fit the roof tent. I hope to mount the tent on the front half of the vehicle thou. Which should avoid issues with SWR changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For power I connected the CB positive and negative directly to the fuse panel linked to my secondary battery. This ensures I do not increase the risk on the start battery and also ensures I have a decent earth to the vehicle and hence the antenna ground plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once powered up the CB is surprisingly intuitive to use. Power, volume and channel selection are carried out via the top three buttons. Scanning and squelch via the buttons on the front. I have not had a chance to carry out and decent conversations yet, but have listened to a few, audio is very clear, thanks to two speakers. I am hopeful the Venus will be a decent performer. We&amp;#039;ll let you know once we have used it over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How To Install and Test a CB Radio Antenna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When installing the antenna and CB it is important to do a few basic things to ensure success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am detailing this due to the amount of CB problem posts I see on forums. These should be done before you try and use the CB for communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When fixing the mount to the vehicle, ensure that it is positioned so that the antenna does not have a lot of metal body work running up the side of it, especially by the coil at the base of the antenna if you have one. See the first photo on this post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the mount earth has a good bond to the body panel you are fixing it to. It may be necessary to rub the paint away, then seal with silicone over the mount to prevent corrosion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the earth and antenna feed are isolated from one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The easiest way to check this is by testing at the CB antenna feed plug (the plug you put in the back of the CB). Check from the centre pin to the barrel (shield), using a multimeter set to the ohm range. This should be open circuit or at least many Mega ohms. Try not to touch the barrel or probes, you will cause a lower reading, depending on how conductive you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next check the barrel of the plug to earth this should be very low I would aim for less than 0.5 ohms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If these readings are good then you have the basis for a good SWR. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However. You must ensure you use decent quality cable, which is 50 ohm, ideally a decent RG58, with both foil and braided shield. Try to avoid routing via noisy electrical components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power wiring of your CB should be ideally straight from the battery positive and negative. Mine is linked to the second battery fuse panel on my split charge. Make sure it is fused properly!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally check that the negative wire of the power to the shield of the antenna feed also has a low resistance. If not you need to fix this and aim for less than an ohm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next connect up your SWR meter and ensure you are outside in a clear area. Follow the instructions that you have with the meter, you need to get this as low as possible. Personally I was happy with the reading I got over the whole range Which was less than 1.4. You should work to be at least below 1.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps people, I wish I had a pound for each high SWR reading. If I missed anything or it is not clear let me know, I&amp;#039;ll clarify or update.&lt;/p&gt;
