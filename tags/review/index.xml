&lt;h2&gt;The Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been trying to find the right sleeping solution for the three of us since, pretty much the first trip we ever went on. The problem we have always had is that we would prefer to be able to wild camp or free camp, but having a family tent made this almost impossible. Not to mention the time it takes to put up and take down a larger tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed we moved onto two small back packing tents one for Cassie and one for us. A two and three man. The plan being in camp sites we use both, in the bush we use one. What we often found though, was that it was hard to find a decent spot for the Landy and a three man tent. If we were walking it would have been fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the family tent for two years, then the small tents for about two years. We eventually slimmed our arsenal of tents down to the family tent, which will be sold this year, it was only kept for the in-laws on this last trip; the three man backpacking tent we will keep for walking and biking; Cassie&amp;#039;s pop up tent and now the latest addition is a roof tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this trip we took the pop up tent and the new roof tent. The plan being that we would all sleep in the roof tent in the wild, then at campsites we would use both tents to allow us to get a good nights sleep, without being kicked and punched by Cassie all night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enquiries about purchasing the roof tent started about 6 or 7 weeks before we left. We were hoping to go and check one out, then get one shortly after. What ended up happening actually, was that we got really busy and were not able to get to a place to see one, it was quite a way. What also happened was that we had to wait for a delivery from Cape Town, South Africa by sea. Luckily we were able to secure one of the items which had already departed in the next batch to be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-21-jul-2012-1525.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up paying a deposit and hoping the tents would not be delayed in customs. They were supposed to clear by the first week of July. We thought that would be perfect as we could get a couple of nights camping in to make sure everything was ok. Inevitably that did not happen as you would expect, nothing is that simple. We managed to get the tent the Friday before we left. Paul from Myway came down from Doncaster to fit it and train us! Which was a nice touch. Needless to say the tent is superb. One thing led to another and we were not able to get out camping that weekend, so would have to just wait till the actual trip. Fingers crossed everything would be ok! In the end we did manage to find time on the Southdowns to practice putting it up and down including the shower curtain. We also managed to get a few pictures of the process. The pictures below were taken in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Step 1 - Position Car&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-29-jul-2012-1716.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Step 2 - Remove Cover and Insert Ladder&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-29-jul-2012-1718.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Step 3 - Close the Door and reach for the ladder!&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-29-jul-2012-17181.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Step 4 - Rotate about the hinge and open&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-29-jul-2012-17182.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Step 5 - Remember something you forgot.&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-29-jul-2012-17183.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Step 6 - Position ladder and fit stays for the flysheet&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-29-jul-2012-1720.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      And Relax!&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-29-jul-2012-1719.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spoken at length with Paul, we ended up with a Serengeti 1.6m tent, we had originally wanted to get an Evolution because it was lighter and not canvas and we wanted a 1.8m as it was wider. Paul assured us that the Serengeti was a good choice and that a 1.6 was plenty wide enough for us and Cassie. He was so confident that he assured me if we were not happy we&amp;#039;d sort &#34;something&#34; out! The man proved to know his stuff. The other advantage of the Serengeti was that the canvas would keep the light out in the morning. We found it easy to sleep till nine at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In writing this so far, I&amp;#039;ve missed a beat, in between paying a deposit and getting the tent I had to find a platform to mount the tent to on top of the Landy. I spent quite a lot of time trying to work out if I wanted a roof rack or roof bars. Roof tents in general are heavy. Myway tents are lighter than most, the 1.6m we were waiting for weighed in at circa 50kg. Most are about 20kg more, with some hitting the 90kg mark for family models. A decent roof rack is about 40 to 50kg, with the Landy and a lot of other cars rated at about 100kg for roof loads, I&amp;#039;d want the lightest mounting system possible. Roof bars are about 5kg approximately each. It seemed an obvious choice considering we did not need a rack at the moment and could do with saving some money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-2-aug-2012-1550.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found various bars around, I wanted something sturdy though. Really because of the off roading factor and mounting the awning. I toyed with getting some boab / mantec bars, I forget what they are called, but dismissed that because I was not convinced they were robust enough for us. Boab also, did some other bars called Boab bars in a 40mm x 40mm or 40mm x 20mm section. I opted for the 40mm square option. I ordered three of these as I needed to mount my awning using u-bolts. This offered a significant weight and cost saving over a rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Construction and Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of construction the tent is made on an aluminium base frame which uses stainless brackets and bolts with aluminium rivets in places, this has a marine ply base attached via captive nuts and bolts. The base frame has a bolted stainless hinge arrangement on either side of the frame, this is the point at which the aluminium hoop tubes attach which support the main tent canvas. The canvas hangs on the hoops, this allows the fly sheet to lay over the top of the whole arrangement. This leaves about a 40 or 50mm gap between the inner tent and flysheet, depending on how the two are adjusted. This gap allows plenty of airflow and is probably a contributing factor to the lack of condensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The canvas inner tent is coated with a waterproofing agent, as is the flysheet. With this coating the canvas is free from the normal leaks you get on the first outing. This did not mean we escaped unscathed. We suffered a small amount of leaking on the first night due to the fly sheet being incorrectly adjusted and hanging on the inner canvas, it was a very minor leak and we did not see the issue again after we adjusted and experimented a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tent is delivered with about a 40mm sponge mattress and a fitted green sheet. The foam is covered in nylon so you need the sheet. The mattress cover is arranged such that it hindges in the middle and folds flat when the tent is packed away. We found the mattress fairly soft, so was easy to feel the base underneath, it took a little getting used to. We tended not to notice so much when we slept in sleeping bags in colder climates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to leave some bedding in the tent when it is packed away, but it must be folded flat before the tent is folded. It should be left on the fixed half of the tent. Failure to fold the bedding flat will result in it bunching when the tent is put away and putting extra strain on the hinge, which could lead to failure of the hinge if excessive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few nights we did discover one issue with the tent, which we now have a solution for. This came about due to a design change, apparently ours is one of the first of a new design. The cross member behind the hinge tended to sag by approx 10mm, this put a noticeable step in the middle of the base, between the two halves of the tent. Unfortunately we could feel this through the mattress. Tents before the design change had some locating pegs to ensure the cross members of the two halves were mechanically linked, so any sag was minimised and mutual, this most importantly avoided a difference in the two plywood base halves. In order to remedy this we will be installing some locating pegs, which will actually be formed by the cap heads of some stainless steel bolts. These will interface to locating holes on the second half cross member which folds down. The important thing about this issue was that it did not prevent us from enjoying the tent and when we got back, Paul offered some brilliant support for discussion to come up with a solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the underside of the folding half of the tent a channel is mounted to the base. This allows the addition of a &#34;shower curtain&#34; which is essentially three sides of a walled room with no ground sheet and a small cut out for the ladder, the Landy forms the fourth wall. The ladder is outside the room. We tried this briefly on the Downs but never used this on the trip. The way we have the tent mounted means that it would provide shelter at the back of the Landy into the rear door during inclement weather, with the door open. The additional kit comes in a small bag, so is light enough to carry around. I just never want to have to use it. It takes 2 or 3 minutes to install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appart from the minor niggle above, we had a great time with the Serengeti this holiday. We enjoyed the quick set up and pack away times. Wendy and I got quite a good routine established that meant we could put our feet up quicker and be on the road sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of the quick set up time means it gives more confidence for camping discreetly as it can be set up at dusk and packed away at dawn when no one is around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of quality, the construction is excellent and modular, so if something needs changing it can be and would be fairly simple, probably without having to go to Myway for spares. The only thing I would pick up Myway (the factory) on is the construction process. We found a lot of swarf in the tent and on the aluminium components. This was because the components are drilled during assembly, rather than drilled cleared and then assembled. It would not be hard to fix this process issue and would save some customer annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short I would not be able to compare against other roof tents as I have not had the chance to look at them, but I can say with confidence that the Myway Serengeti 1.6 meter is an excellent buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get one!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lafayette Venus CB Radio Install</title>
      <link>http://africanuhambo.github.io/2012/06/10/lafayette-venus-cb-radio-install/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Jun 2012 09:55:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://africanuhambo.github.io/2012/06/10/lafayette-venus-cb-radio-install/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-9-jun-2012-2011.jpg?w=225&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; alt=&#34;CB Antenna Mounting Location on the back of the Defender&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been meaning to install a CB radio for several years, I finally got round to it this year. On the last few trips, we have found that we could have done with a CB to communicate with others in the group at various stages. It is not always possible to depend on mobile phones for short range and duration communications. Apart from the issues and expense of roaming outside UK, the connection time is too long and the likelihood of a reliable signal is low when in a remote location.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been looking at various models of CB for a while, I wanted a euro compatible model as I would most likely use the CB abroad more than in the UK. This would allow me to switch the frequency range to suit which ever country we are visiting. The other important requirement was a unit that would take up little room in the Defender cab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the suppliers had pretty much the same range of products, prices did vary slightly. All seemed to do various kits or packages. I was not after a sophisticated CB as long as it covered the Euro zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-6-jun-2012-2016.jpg?w=300&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;198&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much browsing and looking at reviews, I narrowed my choice down to two. These are the Intek M-100 Plus and the Lafayette Venus. Both are small units, the Intek is narrow at 100mm wide and about 37mm high, but has made up for its slender face by being slightly long at about 200mm including the rear plug and front knobs. The Intek has the a fairly conventional layout with a simple handset and the main unit housing the controls and display. The Venus CB unit is also slender at 108mm wide, 29mm high and 136mm deep. The big difference of the Venus from the Intek is that the layout is not that conventional. It has a plain base unit, with a fairly complex handset that houses the display and all the controls. This gives the Venus a fairly complex look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-9-jun-2012-20117.jpg?w=224&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; width=&#34;224&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-9-jun-2012-20111.jpg?w=224&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;224&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of the Venus layout is the base unit is discreet. This is the main attraction to me. In many countries CB is illegal or at least frowned upon. So in the case of the Venus, I can simple disconnect the handset and stow it out of sight and also unscrew the antenna from the rear of the vehicle. This will mean that it should not be noticed that we have a CB at any borders. I can go one step further also. The unit has a power connector so to completely remove the base unit it is simply a matter of disconnecting power and antenna plugs, these stow being the fuse panel in the Defender out of sight and the base unit can be hidden anywhere. In the picture on the right you can see how the cables would be stowed behind the cover to the left of the CB unit. I had considered mounting the module under the cubby box or inside the cubby box, but in the end I decided against it for amongst other reasons heat dissipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-6-jun-2012-2024.jpg?w=300&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;269&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in the strange situation this year, that I actually am travelling with people from the outset and needed to source a CB for them also. This gave rise to the opportunity to buy both the Intek and the Lafayette. The Intek should be good for their use as it is easy to stow and use in an adhoc manner thanks to the 12 volt plug that is fitted. This gives the opportunity to test both radios for a month on the road. If the Venus turns out to be a dog, then I&amp;#039;ll swap for the Intek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-6-jun-2012-2034.jpg?w=180&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I would mount the antenna to the rear of the vehicle with a body mount. This position allows the antenna to be mounted high, which should aid the range of the CB, it also proved fairly easy to get a decent SWR reading, though out both the UK and Euro bands I get a maximum reading of Circa 1.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may have to review this antenna location once we fit the roof tent. I hope to mount the tent on the front half of the vehicle thou. Which should avoid issues with SWR changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For power I connected the CB positive and negative directly to the fuse panel linked to my secondary battery. This ensures I do not increase the risk on the start battery and also ensures I have a decent earth to the vehicle and hence the antenna ground plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once powered up the CB is surprisingly intuitive to use. Power, volume and channel selection are carried out via the top three buttons. Scanning and squelch via the buttons on the front. I have not had a chance to carry out and decent conversations yet, but have listened to a few, audio is very clear, thanks to two speakers. I am hopeful the Venus will be a decent performer. We&amp;#039;ll let you know once we have used it over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How To Install and Test a CB Radio Antenna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When installing the antenna and CB it is important to do a few basic things to ensure success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am detailing this due to the amount of CB problem posts I see on forums. These should be done before you try and use the CB for communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When fixing the mount to the vehicle, ensure that it is positioned so that the antenna does not have a lot of metal body work running up the side of it, especially by the coil at the base of the antenna if you have one. See the first photo on this post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the mount earth has a good bond to the body panel you are fixing it to. It may be necessary to rub the paint away, then seal with silicone over the mount to prevent corrosion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the earth and antenna feed are isolated from one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The easiest way to check this is by testing at the CB antenna feed plug (the plug you put in the back of the CB). Check from the centre pin to the barrel (shield), using a multimeter set to the ohm range. This should be open circuit or at least many Mega ohms. Try not to touch the barrel or probes, you will cause a lower reading, depending on how conductive you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next check the barrel of the plug to earth this should be very low I would aim for less than 0.5 ohms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If these readings are good then you have the basis for a good SWR. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However. You must ensure you use decent quality cable, which is 50 ohm, ideally a decent RG58, with both foil and braided shield. Try to avoid routing via noisy electrical components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power wiring of your CB should be ideally straight from the battery positive and negative. Mine is linked to the second battery fuse panel on my split charge. Make sure it is fused properly!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally check that the negative wire of the power to the shield of the antenna feed also has a low resistance. If not you need to fix this and aim for less than an ohm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next connect up your SWR meter and ensure you are outside in a clear area. Follow the instructions that you have with the meter, you need to get this as low as possible. Personally I was happy with the reading I got over the whole range Which was less than 1.4. You should work to be at least below 1.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps people, I wish I had a pound for each high SWR reading. If I missed anything or it is not clear let me know, I&amp;#039;ll clarify or update.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Instrument Binnacle (Cowl) - Raptor Engineering</title>
      <link>http://africanuhambo.github.io/2012/05/30/instrument-binnacle-cowl-raptor-engineering/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2012 05:35:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://africanuhambo.github.io/2012/05/30/instrument-binnacle-cowl-raptor-engineering/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-27-may-2012-0913.jpg?w=420&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;473&#34; alt=&#34;Dash Explosion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The binnacle on the Defender is the part that surrounds the instruments in front of the driver, it secures to the underside of the dashboard top surface. The binnacle is also known as the instrument cowl. Item 1 In the picture on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binnacle provides a frame to mount the instrument panel and heater controls onto. On older Defenders and I expect Series vehicles also, it is common to find them cracked and falling apart, this leads to the surrounding components being loose and fee to move. In my case leading to an annoying medley of squeaks and rattles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a simple job, apart from a couple of ackward screws, to replace the binnacle, a standard plastic replacement is available from various part suppliers at about £50. I believe the part number is MTC2808. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The problem with replacing like for like is that eventually the replacement will end up in the same state as the original, I suspect the combined effects of heat, vibration and UV on the exposed sections probably cause the failure. That together with heavy hands. I suppose you would hope that modern replacements are of a better specified plastic and more hardy. Not knowing for sure I wanted an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-27-may-2012-0934.jpg?w=343&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;343&#34; height=&#34;343&#34; alt=&#34;Raptor Binnacle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily a powder coated steel equivalent is available from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raptor-engineering.co.uk/defender-s111-binnacle-mount&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;Raptor Engineering Binnacle&#34;&gt;Raptor Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, at around the same price as the plastic replacement. I decided I would go for this when I replaced the binnacle on our Defender. I did not fancy doing the job again in the future. Picture on the right shows what it looks like. I forgot to take a before picture, so have pinched the one from Raptor&amp;#039;s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the good things about the Raptor replacement is that there are less of the fiddly screws to put back, once they are out. Also the lugs at the top of the mount, were the top of the instrument panel secures to are adjustable, allowing an element of fine tuning the final position of the instrument panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On thing that would have been nice as an option on purchase, would have been a kit of u-nuts and original spec screws. I found that I had various bits missing, probably lost with bits of dash before my time. I think I would have purchase the extras at the time if I had the option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-27-may-2012-08284.jpg?w=351&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;351&#34; height=&#34;262&#34; alt=&#34;Broken Defender Binnacle Instrument Cowl&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually managed to get the old binnacle out and it was only then that I realised how bad it was. There were pieces from both sides and the back missing, there were also various cracks which prevented the captive nut things securing properly, which are supposed to hold the side panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my suspicions that the rear section in the picture on the left was broken when the immobiliser was fitted for my insurance. I found the missing bit deep in the dash below the hazard relay etc. the other side of the binnacle looks similar to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-27-may-2012-082710.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;224&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the old one is out the Raptor replacement dropped straight in. I loosely fitted it to start with to allow me to make sure everything lined up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once happy, I secured the main fixings and then the heater controls to the binnacle. As I had screws and u-nuts missing, I decided to replace all of the side self tapping screws with round head hex M5 screws and nuts, that are black anodised. This matches the adjustable tab screws provided by Raptor and looks smart, it also gave me the spares to secure the front properly. The only self tappers are the four that secure the main instrument panel to the binnacle. Picture below if you are interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-27-may-2012-0827.jpg?w=358&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;358&#34; height=&#34;268&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the Raptor product, it makes a very sturdy replacement, fits well and gives the dash a fresher look. I would highly recommend using this as a standard replacement.&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Keys Locked in - The Frostfire Mooncode 1555 Portable Key Storage</title>
      <link>http://africanuhambo.github.io/2012/04/24/keys-locked-in-the-frostfire-mooncode-1555-portable-key-storage/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2012 20:10:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://africanuhambo.github.io/2012/04/24/keys-locked-in-the-frostfire-mooncode-1555-portable-key-storage/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-20-may-2012-0855.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; alt=&#34;Frostfire Mooncode 1555&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If you have read about our trip last year, you will know that we locked the keys in the Landy in Croatia. We normally have at least a door key on us each, in order to try and prevent this situation. However it was quite late in the holiday and the inevitable happened. Both doors slam, I see the keys swinging in the ignition. I can also see Wendy&amp;#039;s bag on the passenger floor. Just to confirm, I ask where her keys are. My suspicion is confirmed!...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been saying every year we must do something about this. But what do you do? Leaving a key stashed is tricky and potentially easy to find, added to that most solutions are magnetic, which is useless on a landy. I wanted something of a more robust and secure nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While browsing the net I came across the Mooncode key safe, which is an oversized padlock shaped device with a combination code to open. The body has space sufficient to allow stashing of a key and bank card. The padlock mechanism would allow it to be locked to the landy. The device looked ideal. I ordered one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way I will say now, this will only be used while we are away. I have no intention of leaving it fitted or broadcasting where it is fitted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-24-may-2011-1227.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;256&#34; alt=&#34;Closed Mooncode Key Safe&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On arrival I was keen to check out the new toy, first impression was that it is fairly robust and heavy device, the padlock clasp is covered in transparent rubber to help prevent it rattling, the rear of the body is covered in fairly heavy duty rubber foam, both of these also help protect car paint work. In my case it will help prevent the rattling in the eventual stowage location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to release the clasp of the padlock you have to know the code, this is a good feature. The release mechanism is internal to Moodcode&amp;#039;s body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-24-may-2011-12271.jpg?w=441&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;441&#34; height=&#34;251&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that would be an improvement, is if the Moodcode was waterproof. The body will prevent splashes and light rain entering the chamber that contains the keys etc, by the shape of the closing edges, the inside and outside edges overlap but will not prevent water ingress. I did wonder if I could seal it with some stick rubber strip, I&amp;#039;ll have a play sometime on that one. Obviously for the use of overlanders and 4wd&amp;#039;s it would be much better If waterproof. If the manufacturers considered this they would also need to consider the code wheels and mechanism as I am sure this would not take long to suffer from dust ingress and seize up. I think to help it survive the latter it will have the code wheels taped up in situ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not decide where it will go yet. We&amp;#039;ll let you know how it survives the holiday this year. Have any of you got a decent solution to locking your keys in the car?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We&#39;re taking Blogsy on a road trip.</title>

      <guid>http://africanuhambo.github.io/2012/04/20/were-taking-blogsy-on-a-road-trip/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-19-apr-2012-1947.jpg?w=164&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;164&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; alt=&#34;Blogsy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We have traditionally kept a Moleskin notebook with us when we are on the road, the current one is on its third trip. I would hate for it to go missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;In the back we record all the cool things like mileages, fuel costs and locations we fill up at. This enables us to keep a log of our fuel consumption. Potentially a sign of an impending problem. We also record accommodation, ferry and toll costs. I often think it would be good if there was more cost information available for overlanders. My intention is to look at the general cost per unit of distance. I believe an accurate assumption can be made for longer trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;In the front we use it as a diary or journal we record how the day went, what we did, what was said, funny moments and other such things. The journal itself is a good read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Traditionally when we get home we have every intention of putting our journal story on the web, this often happens many months later. The moment has passed and the story element is lost. Reading the past storys can be a slog. This is for a few reasons; the delay in transferring the story to the site, the size of the task. We are aware of these issues and hate that the moment can be lost in the writing, as the journeys to us are so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;To try and improve on these issues we are still going to use our journal, but have decided we will post the story in the style of a blog rather than a webpage. To do this we will use the iPad to post the blog as we go. We often camp and it is at these moments we have time, we are relaxed and in the mood to write these entries. The iPad is the ideal tool for this. The important part of this is we will be immersed in the trip while we are writing, so still living the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;To enable us to do this we are going to use a few tools, firstly we will be using Blogsy which is a blogging app for the iPad, I suggest you check it out by the way, it is the best of what I have tried. For some reason this app makes you want to post, it has a great feel and brings together everything you need in a great interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We will also be using iPhoto to manage, edit and upload photos. To do this we will be getting a camera connection kit for the iPad shortly. I&amp;#039;ll update you on this soon on this. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Useful Books for Travel and Planning</title>
      <link>http://africanuhambo.github.io/2012/04/17/useful-books-for-travel-and-planning/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2012 16:23:04 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://africanuhambo.github.io/2012/04/17/useful-books-for-travel-and-planning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-15-apr-2012-2218.jpg?w=234&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;234&#34; height=&#34;308&#34; alt=&#34;Unesco World Heritage Sites&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Over the last few years we have read and used various travel related books. Some have been good, some have been great and some we just did not get on with. This may not mean they are bad, it is just that certain types of writing suits certain people better than others. A good example of this is in travel guides, we tend to prefer Bradt guides over Lonely planet. Most people swear by Lonely Planet guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;One of our most frequently used books is the UNESCO World Heritage site guide, it is a massive book with loads of superb pictures a page or two on each site, not all sites have a photo though, it would be nice if they all did and were at least a page in size, perhaps in the next release? At the beginning of the book are nice maps on several pages showing all the site locations and page numbers, these form a nice geographical index. In the back is a compressive index of each site together with a handy index by country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/P1060012.JPG&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;332&#34; height=&#34;249&#34; alt=&#34;Look out for our book!&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;This is actually our second copy. We think we lost the first in a vineyard in Portugal somewhere, when we were exploring off road. In case you are in the area, I think this is where it was! Near the bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We find this book is excellent when we are musing over ideas with our Michelin 1:1,000,000 Europe map for instance. It allows you to get an idea of what is enroute. Just beware after a few beers plans can get somewhat over enthusiastic! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-16-apr-2012-22231.jpg?w=128&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;128&#34; height=&#34;197&#34; alt=&#34;Europe on a shoestring&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Having said we prefer Bradt guides, which was actually a fairly late discovery. We do have a fair few Lonely planet guides and one we keep referring to is Europe on a shoestring. It seems to make it into the car every year. At over five years old it is not only getting out of date but also somewhat dog eared. If  you want a handy general guide this is one to have, if you need more detail, grab a specific guide for the country or preferably the area you want to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;What this book does well is gives you ideas of itineraries, budgets and key things or places to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-16-apr-2012-2229.jpg?w=207&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;207&#34; height=&#34;273&#34; alt=&#34;No doctor&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;For medical questions and some things you would rather not waste the doctor&amp;#039;s time with, we have often referred to Where There Is No Doctor. Horribly detailed and super useful, this one lives in the Landy. It is not really a first aid book, more of a Haynes manual for you body. If you are squeamish at the best of times look away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;I was very luck to get a good tip for purchasing my copy of Tom Sheppard&amp;#039;s book the Vehicle Dependent Expedition Guide. When I was looking I was shocked at the prices. When you have read the book you will understand why they command such a price. The level of detail is astonishing and will leave any other book on the topic standing in its shadow. The tip I got was to phone the Royal Geographic Society to purchase a discounted copy from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-16-apr-2012-2240.jpg?w=189&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;189&#34; height=&#34;258&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;I am still reading Tom&amp;#039;s book to this day, it lives beside my bed. The reason is that it is a good reference and I don&amp;#039;t think a cover to cover type read. You need to take your time to absorb the topics in this book. The devil is most definitely in the detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;This book will answer all the questions you have from logging your trip in detail, maintenance of your vehicle to the type of sleeping arrangement you want. If you can think of a vehicle related question, the answer is probably in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Definitely a good book to start reading and referring to during what ever you are planning for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/wpid-photo-16-apr-2012-2255.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;210&#34; height=&#34;273&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Since I purchased this book I have also read another of Tom&amp;#039;s books called Quiet for a Tuesday. This book you should buy even if you only plan to look at the photos! It is an account of Tom&amp;#039;s trip to Algeria, where he had all his maps confiscated by officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Luckily thanks to his insanely methodical record keeping, Tom managed to navigate and enjoy his journey in the Algerian Sahara. Whilst avoiding the authorities!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;sites-canvas-main&#34; style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;He finds out during his covert travels whilst trying to recover the maps with the help of contacts back home, that the Authorities most definitely do not want him to stay! So having acknowledged this will probably be his last trip in Algeria he makes the most of the journey. Which will probably end up in him being banned from Algeria, due to a misunderstanding, which is exactly what happened in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boab Braai</title>
      <link>http://africanuhambo.github.io/2012/03/25/boab-braai/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2012 09:59:29 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://africanuhambo.github.io/2012/03/25/boab-braai/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We have been going thru cheap portable braai&amp;#039;s (aka bbq&amp;#039;s) like cheap toilet paper. They are generally made of very thin pressed sheet steel and don&amp;#039;t last. The cost of these and the disposibles we occasionally resort to has begun to add up. So we have resorted to buying a decent portable... The Boab Braai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/p1100423.jpg?w=300&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-232&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We purchased the braai from Boab.biz in 2010, they import stuff from South Africa and have a nice expanding product range. The first impression you get when it turns up is the sheer weight of the thing. This is not a Braai you walk far with. We live about 600 meters from the beach and it is hard work carrying it down just that far! It is perfect in the back of the Landy thou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;As you will no doubt know this braai is fairly well travelled, it has been used in over 12 countries with us and is now about to be used on the third summer trek. It is now obviously fairly dirty, but a good clean now and again brings it back to life. The surprising thing is how well the paint work has held out. We have actually been fairly rubbish at cleaning it etc, left it in the rain and there is little sign of corrosion. This is obviously a desirable feature in a braai. I keep thinking I will need to touch the paint up, but have so far put it off as it is no where near bad yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/p1100424.jpg?w=300&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-231&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; alt=&#34;Boab Braai - Hard at work on the South Downs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;One of the nice things about the Boab Braai, is the grill is of a decent size. Meaning you can easily cook for about 5 people depending on what you are cooking. The grill is also a heavy duty mesh and frame so does not buckle or get damaged with repeated cleaning or time. You will also fail to loose sausages through the grill due to the grill having a square pattern!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;One of the nice features of the Boab Braai is that the lid also has legs and becomes a handy cooking table for beer and utensils. One feature of the lid we have not tried is the griddle. Perhaps soon. Thou. The braai also comes with a handy pot holding arm, we use this for utensils, as we generally use out petrol Coleman stove for pots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The only downside with the Braai, is that due to the dimensions and design it can be tricky to get started if you are complacent in setting up the coals. This is because there is no vents for air to get in at the base of the fire. Since I purchased the Boab Braai they have added a log burner base to the accessories which would adress this. In reality if you are an experience fire starter (twisted fire started, sorry...) this will not be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The great thing about the Boab Braai is that the grade of material allows for a decnt camp fire after dinner. Just don&amp;#039;t get done by a forest ranger like we did, who promptly doused the Boab Braai with water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Verdict: Get one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Boab Braai Datasheet PDF&#34; href=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/boab-ultimate-braai-factsheet.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the data sheet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After two years of road trips into Europe and the prospect of more lengthy and exotic trips in the future, the struggle with not having enough cold beer got too much. We decided to look at our options for a portable car fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;In the land of 12 volt fridges all is not equal. The cheap ones you generally see in places like Halfords (local automotive accessory store) tend to work by making use of the Peltier Junction effect. Basically it is an electrical junction. You stick the fridge on one side of the junction and a heat sink and fan on the other. Electrically charge the junction blow the heat of the top and the other side gets cold. Simples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The downfall of these fridges is that they are generally quite power intensive and have a limited cooling differential from ambient. This is not ideal in warmer European countries, but may well be sufficient in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The better option is to get a fridge such as the Waeco CF-18, it has a Danfoss compressor, similar to that which is used in a standard fridge or air conditioner. The whole unit is fairly efficient and works on a refrigerant circuit the same as your fridge at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We got this fridge for Summer 2009, on the advice of a friend, who tends to buy decent stuff. We have now used it for three years in countries from Portugal to Montenegro. It is superb and will run for up to three days on our split charging system, depending on the temperature in the Landy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/waeco-cf-18-diamentions.jpg?w=244&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-213 alignright&#34; width=&#34;244&#34; height=&#34;148&#34; alt=&#34;Waeco Dimensions&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;One word of advice. This fridge has worked well for us. It would be nice to have a larger one thou, so buy bigger if you can afford to and can store it between trips. This fridge is big enough for two two litre bottles some small items of meat, yoghurt and butter and milk. Oh and the odd chocolate bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Secondly watch out for the insulation level. If the manufacturer offers an insulating sleeve or blanket buy it. It will help in the hottest environments. Remember you car parked in the sun with windows closed could easily reach over 45 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/img-20120323-00107.jpg?w=300&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-240 alignleft&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; alt=&#34;Insulating Cover&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cover for the CF-18 seems to be of a reasonable quality, a decent fit , with lashing eyes and additional pockets. It will cost about an extra £35 delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom is removable, by using the zipper provided. The foil lining should make for easy cleaning. The only downside is the black top material, a light grey would have been better. Having said that thou the material is certainly tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.github.io/assets/img-20120323-001141.jpg?w=300&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-242&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; alt=&#34;Insulating Cover Vent&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Verdict: If you are after a smaller Fridge. We would definitely recommend this fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Others to consider are National Luna and Engel.
