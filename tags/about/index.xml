      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;This Blog is the story of what will lead to our eventual &#34;great expedition&#34;, initially (back in 2007) planned for the continent of Africa to depart in 2009, but is now probably going to be the Middle East and Asia, some time in the future. In the meantime we have been trying to fit in as many trips as we can, which we are using to soothe our itchy feet, these are our &#34;mini expeditions&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We are: Dan - A Libyan born Brit; Wendy - South African born and our daughter Cassie - Made in Brighton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Back in 2007 our original plan was to travel to Cape Town from Brighton, in the U.K, along the East Coast of Africa. However one thing lead to another and we had to kill that for a while...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;This is &#39;US&#39;&#34; alt=&#34;You should see a picture of &#39;US&#39;&#34; src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/P1060220.JPG&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The African trip started as a joke. Dan threw a suggestion, out of the blue, about selling the flat and travelling the world. This we talked about as a &#39;dream&#39; over the next few months and it slowly morphed from &#39;travelling the world&#39; into &#39;overlanding Africa&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;What the eventual trip will look like who knows, in the meantime we&#39;ll be having fun and working towards our goal...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;And so the journey begins......&lt;/p&gt;
