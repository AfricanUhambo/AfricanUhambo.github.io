      <title>Needed a lightweight stove</title>
      <link>http://africanuhambo.co.uk/2013/06/23/needed-a-lightweight-stove/</link>

      <guid>http://africanuhambo.co.uk/2013/06/23/needed-a-lightweight-stove/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I needed to get a lightweight stove for a quick camping microadventure on Saturday night. I did not want to buy one and was considering self heating meals and no coffee in the morning. Until I found inspiration from a post on twitter to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/64726512&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; by Tom Allen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to have a go at building my own also. I had some mentholated spirit for fuel, I just needed a drink can to make the stove. After a quick trip to the local shop, and with my thirst quenched I had my raw material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-jun-2013-1013.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-jun-2013-10131.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-jun-2013-10132.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-jun-2013-10133.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trimmed the top and bottom sections. Bottom section is about 30mm high, the top is about 50mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-jun-2013-2035.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-jun-2013-20351.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creat flues in the side of the can with a knife. Small at the top. Large at the bottom. These form the generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-jun-2013-20352.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mate both sections&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-jun-2013-20353.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ridges are critical. They are small at the top, large at the bottom. They form the fuel generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a small hole using a pin just under the top lip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-jun-2013-20354.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a small amount of fuel, approx 5mm deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-jun-2013-20355.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light, wait 10 seconds for fuel to heat in the generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-jun-2013-10134.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once hot the fuel vaporises in the side ridges, which is the generator the flames only burn on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-jun-2013-10135.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took about 5 minutes to boil two cups of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-jun-2013-1012.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weights very little too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-jun-2013-10121.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field test!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-jun-2013-2007.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by the stove, it had no trouble heating my dinner or boiling water in my coffee maker. Just keep it out of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know how these work. Check out this &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage-can_stove&#34;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weekend stroll - Ford to Littlehampton, West Sussex</title>
      <link>http://africanuhambo.co.uk/2013/04/28/weekend-stroll-ford-to-littlehampton-west-sussex/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2013 19:50:42 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://africanuhambo.co.uk/2013/04/28/weekend-stroll-ford-to-littlehampton-west-sussex/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the weather forecast looking good, we decided that today we were going for a walk, a walk with criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criteria was that it had to have a start and finish at a railway station and that we wanted to say away from crowds. It also had to have locations that would be suitable for a picnic lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said we decided to head on the train to Ford from our local station, 36 minutes away. The plan was to follow the river Arun towards the beach the follow the foot paths and a byway to bring us on to the beach circa 2 miles west of Littlehampton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/fordtolittlehamptonwalk.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had lunch on the beach then headed for the railway station in Littlehampton to head home. We timed it perfectly arriving three minutes before the 1414 to London departed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This route took us about 2.5 hours and is pretty flat, it is just under 10 kilometers. So with lunch we averaged about 4 km/h.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to download the GPX file, you can grab it from &lt;a title=&#34;GPS Route&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3lq5J_TSkjFMDBmTmU3TnZ2dzg/edit?usp=sharing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Durmitor National Park, Montenegro - Garmin Maps</title>
      <link>http://africanuhambo.co.uk/2012/04/28/durmitor-national-park-montenegro-maps/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2012 20:04:24 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://africanuhambo.co.uk/2012/04/28/durmitor-national-park-montenegro-maps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-11-sep-2011-10142.jpg?w=253&#34; alt=&#34;Durmitor National Park 1:25000 map&#34; width=&#34;253&#34; height=&#34;338&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we stayed in Durmitor National park, during our August 2011 trip, the guy who seemed to run the camp site at &lt;a title=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;http://www.durmitor-autocamp.com/home.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Autocamp Razvršje&lt;/a&gt;, gave us a great walking map, which I kept, being a map addict. Actually I think he gave one to everyone, so we weren&#39;t special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, by luck the other day they sent out a marketing email. Intrigued I browsed their site and noticed they had an electronic copy of the map and others on their site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are pretty good maps of the area in 1:25,000 scale. So I thought I would grab a copy for next time I am there. Anyway, follow the link above to their site to get a copy or there are links below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if you need a place to stay, Autocamp Razvršje is as good as any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: Some Garmin devices such as the Montana series allow the importing of custom maps. This is done via Google Earth. You have to import the map as a layer to Google Earth then align it (georeference), then save it as a KMZ. Once this is done you can import it to Garmin&#39;s Basecamp or upload it and save it to the Custom Map folder on your GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a copy of the Durmitor KMZ I made click &lt;a title=&#34;Garmin Durmitor KMZ&#34; href=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/Durmitor National Park Map 25k.kmz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructions on creating custom maps are available &lt;a href=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/custommaps_instruct.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Wendy and I, have recently walked from Ford railway station to Devils Dyke, we followed the Arun river up-stream past Arundel to Amberley, were we spent the night. From there we walked along the South Downs Way to Devils Dyke. We spent the night in Amberley which is a fantastic little village in Sussex. We recorded the journey with Everytrail, you can follow the link &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=683253&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in the Everytrail recording. We plan to do some more walks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DAY 2/3: SUNDAY 31 July / 1 August 2011 Anould (France) – Stechelberg (Switzerland)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Camping Costs: Camping Breithorn 54.80 CHF – 2 nights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Nice easy drive today. We decided to stop off in Interlaken for lunch. we managed to find parking and off we went for a wonder. Switzerland is expensive!! We knew this from the start, but this was a little more than we imagined. We finally decided to stop and eat, but at great expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Wendy’s Aunt, Uncle and Cousins were currently over from New Zealand. We had had a brief visit with them at Wendy’s Parent’s house a few weeks earlier. They were currently travelling Europe in a Motor home and our paths looked set to cross in Switzerland. We decided to meet up and spend a day together. We found the campsite they told us they were staying at and managed to get a spot of grass. The owner said she was fully booked, but if we didn’t mind camping on her overflow field, we could stay. So there we set up our tents in the corner. The Thornes arrived and they very kindly cooked us a dinner. We had a great catch up and a wonderful meal. We made plans to go for a walk in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We spent the whole night listening to fireworks. The locals were celebrating a national holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/DSCF8238.JPG&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/DSCF8261.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/DSCF8273.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/DSCF8283.JPG&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/DSCF8299.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/DSCF8301.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAY 3: MONDAY 1 AUGUST 2011&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;It turns out that we have arrived in Switzerland during a celebration, Switzerland Day. Swiss flags hang everywhere and fireworks going off at all times of the day…and night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Today we decided to pack lunch and go for a leisurely walk with the Thornes. We walked along the river by the campsite towards the cable car to catch the cable up to Gimmelwald. From there we walked up to Mȕrren where we ate our picnic lunch. Cassie needed a wee, so I ended up buying her a juice so she could use the restaurant toilet. 3CHF for a wee!! From Mȕrren we walked down to Lauterbrunnen. We walked a total of 17km!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We were all now tired and poor Cassie was starting to fade, so we caught the bus home from Lauterbrunnen. We tried to go to the supermarket to get supplies, but it was closed. We ended up buying sausages from the camp shop and putting together a mishmash of a dinner. There were firework displays in the near-by towns of Lauterbrunnen and Stechelberg. By the time we got there (another walk), the display was over, so back to camp we walked. Cas was bombing, so we put her to bed, she slept straight through all the firework banging, only to wake in the middle of the night to tell me that the river next to the camp was far to noisy! The Thorne gang were leaving early in the morning, so we said our goodbyes. We were heading for Austria in the morning, looks like another long drive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DAY 14/15: 20/21 AUGUST  Martin (Slovakia) – Teplice nad Metuji (Czech Republic)</title>

      <guid>http://africanuhambo.co.uk/2010/08/22/day-1415-2021-august-martin-slovakia-teplice-nad-metuji-czech-republic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Camping costs: 560 Crowns – 2 nights = €23.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After an initial hiccup of taking the wrong exit and having to do a big loop, we finally made our way to the Czech. Unfortunately for us the road was VERY slow going. Not a motorway, still a major road, but FULL of trucks and slow moving vehicles making it a long journey. We stopped at 12pm for lunch and a drink, but we were still stuck at about 2pm in a traffic jam with still roughly 90km to go till we get to Adršpach. The traffic was driving us crazy, so we deviated off onto smaller roads. Turned out to be a wise decision and we finally made it to a camp site in Teplice nad Metuji. It was a lovely, quiet camp site. We found a nice quiet spot and set about putting up the new tents. They went up in no time! A HUGE difference from the other tent.We had managed to find a supermarket and cash machine along the way. More ‘funny money’ to get used to. We bought pasta for dinner tonight as we already had bits and bobs to turn it into a feast. We had our pasta with some toast made from the bread that needed to be finished. Wasn’t the best meal, but it wasn’t the worst either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;DAY 15: 21 AUGUST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Dan discovered some maps for the area. The guy at the office said that we could catch the train to Adršpach. We decided to catch the train there and walk back. When we got to the station we discovered that Dan got the times wrong. We changed our plan and instead walked to Adršpach and caught the train back. It was a magnificent walk. You had to pay to get into the National Reserve – 150 Crowns for 2 adults and 1 child. The walk took us through forest, over peat bogs, up steps over the rocks and down steps into the rocks. Overall, we walked for 3 &amp;amp; half hours. Casie did amazingly well considering in some places the steps were so steep and precarious Dan had to carry her! After a good 12mile walk, we finally reached the end. Here we treated ourselves to some chips. We got some souvenirs for Cassie’s friends. We found the train station and awaited our train back to town. Once back at the camp site, we washed and headed out to find some dinner. We had some local food and drank some Czech white wine. We headed back to camp for an early night.&lt;/p&gt;
