      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, the Land Rover left to a new life several weeks ago. I hope she is looked after, it was sad to see her go. Sold to the first viewer at the asking price. I never thought I would sell, but life is full of surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your wondering why? Well we are moving to Melbourne in January 2014 and will start new adventures there. So stay tuned. New Country, New Job... Very Exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
