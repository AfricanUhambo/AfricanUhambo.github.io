      <title>Day 9 - Duga Resa to Bihać</title>
      <link>/2013/08/04/day-9-duga-resa-to-bihac/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2013 19:06:38 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2013/08/04/day-9-duga-resa-to-bihac/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well we had a surprisingly quiet night. We thought we would be woken up, having seen and heard the action at the bar, but managed to sleep through. We packed up promptly and made for a café in Duga Resa. The plan was to have some coffee and find something for breakfast. Duga Resa is a tiny place. At this stage I should point out that we still had not found a local cash machine and all I had was Euros. Which is fine for bigger places, but the lady in the café, did not accept them. By the time I remembered it was obviously too late and I had already ordered the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily the lady had a plan, there was a tiny tiny shop around the corner run by two ladies, who were obviously used to all the tourists from the campsite popping in for bits and bobs. I asked if they would mind changing some Euros for me, they agreed, but had to have a discussion about changing as much as 50 Euro, of course it was by this time too late for me to say &#34;How about 30, then?&#34; which fell on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now back at the café, I sat down for Wendy to tell me what she heard. I should mention that a fat man with a very bad blonde mullet with an irish accent, driving a slovenian plated white van, left the campsite at the same time as us and followed us in to the café. Anyhow, on entering the café I offered for him to go before us in the café while we procrastinated, he declined. After placing our order we heard him say in an irish accent to the Croatian lady &#34;Is the boss around?&#34; Thats unusual! Passing him on the way to the shop, I noticed them talking to a local inside the partially open rear door of the van, I think they used the term Cognac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/p1130484.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I got back and Wendy said, she heard mullet man saying on the phone to a fellow traveller &#34;you better get up here now, there is a shed&#34; our suspicions were confirmed about this lot. About 20 minutes later another of the Irish envoy turned up, in a SUV. Now, remember none of these people speak Croatian. I heard them saying to each other that we spoke english and the language! We can order coffee, beer and juice and ask for the bill. But I have no idea how to say &#34;Do you have a shed we can store our dodgy alcohol in please?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/p1130494.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we left them to it and returned to the shop to grab some stuff for lunch and headed off. We were headed towards Velika Kladuša on the back roads, which lead to some interesting views and sights. Arriving at the border crossing about an hour or so later. By the time we got to the crossing it was getting hot, we queued for about 30 minutes, left Croatia and tried to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina. To be told that the crossing did not have an insurance agent. This meant we would not be able to buy a green card, which meant we had to turn around and re-enter Croatia and head for the Bihać crossing near the Plitviča National Park. Luckily the border guard felt sorry for us and opened up the barrier so we could jump the queue. On the way back through, the Croatia guard recommended that we try to buy insurance at Slunj. We tried and failed there opting to just try at Bihać.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/p1130496.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky at Bihać, the guard did not really care if we had insurance. Normally they hold a passport until you can demonstrate that you have insurance. They returned all our documents and trusted us to go to the offices a 200 meters on and get insurance. The agents building was dark and smelt really bad under the cigarette smoke, housing about 8 or 10 agents. Most of the offices had closed doors with people who did not really care for your presence. I approached a lady who looked at me with slight sympathy in one of the offices asking her for &#34;Osiguranje&#34;, insurance in Croat. She had no idea, knocking and asking on all the doors. Just as she was giving up she told me after a colleague suggested to knock on the last door. I was in luck. They agree to do it, but struggled to find the forms! 30 Euro for 17 days. Moments later I piped out in triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/p1130595.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this we motored towards Bihać not quite sure were to go. We passed the town on the outskirts not really seeing any good parts, and found shortly afterwards a sign for &#34;Autokamp&#34;. We decided we wanted to rest and stopped, it was a camp almost empty in the grounds of an empty hotel, Hotel Ada. There was a Spanish van and a Dutch van on site when we arrived. Later two more arrived. The place was deserted. It was a nice campsite though, it had loads of well established trees which provided tons of shade, no need for the awning. We popped the tent up and explored the river bank for a place to swim in the Una. We were lucky the river was beautiful and nice and cool. We spent about an hour swimming before popping back for a shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night we opted for an early dinner at the next door restaurant. It was a fantasy land from a film, outside it had a spit roast lamb on the go. The main building was an old mill and the river weaved between it and pontoons that supported seating areas. In amongst the pontoons the river flowed clear enough to allow viewing the plants and fish, like being in an aquarium shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a kilogram of lamb with flat bread and salad for dinner, finished off with Baklava and several local beers. All in around 25 Euro and fantastic. We headed to bed after a brief chat with our neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a great first day in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 8 - Bovec to Duga Resa</title>
      <link>/2013/08/03/day-8-bovec-to-duga-resa/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Aug 2013 13:36:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2013/08/03/day-8-bovec-to-duga-resa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We decided that today we needed to get cracking and head south. I would have loved to have stayed longer in Bovec, but the campsite was fully booked over the weekend, so we had to either find another site, or move on.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/p1130475.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, we spent sometime trying to work out where to head, without driving too far, whilst fitting in with our rough plan. We eventually decided to head for the wine road south-west of Zagreb in northern Croatia. This is a road that runs between Samobor and Jastrebarsko and is famed for its wine. We found the area and the road specifically, with no problems. The route was beautiful and the drive was ideal in the Landy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure if I have mentioned previously, but the Garmin Montana GPS is dead (my second one). It does not boot beyond the maps loading at start up, so we are navigating by one of the 1:200k maps we have. Not a problem. Luckily I love maps so have more than enough to compensate. Anyhow, we stopped to get our bearings for a minute, I killed the Landy while Wendy sorted herself out so I could have pee. Jumped back in and the engine did not turn over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I thought I had failed to activate the immobiliser correctly, so did it again. Same outcome. By the third time I could not hear the starter motor solenoid pull in. Ok, I would need a multimeter. Once I grabbed that, I popped off the fuse cover the starter relay was pulling in there was 12 volts on the contact to the solenoid. Which leaves a couple of items as likely causes. Either wiring or connection or starter motor. Engine was too hot and the afternoon was too hot to get close to check either. Not wanting to hang around and given that no one had passed us in 15 minutes, I decided to bump start the Landy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were facing up hill and against the bushes… Luckily I managed to do it in about 2 meters in reverse. We carried on along the route for a while. About 20 minutes on and Cassie needed to wee now, so I stopped nose up a bank. Flicked the ignition and the starter flicked over, good sign… Killed the engine and it restarted, excellent. I suspect connections. I had a similar issue with a connection which was installed by a previous garage removing the stock alarm system. Which I fixed. This had prevented the fuel cut out solenoid activating about 18 months ago. I suspect the same issue here I hope. I&#39;ll replace the crimp when we stop for a couple of days somewhere and I am bored. At the moment the problem has not reoccurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, by this stage we were looking for one of the recommended Vineyards in the Bradt guide, which also had rooms. We found it. But no one was to be found. We waited for a few minutes before deciding to find the second recommendation. This was about another 30 minutes on. We had a different outcome with this, we found signs to the place and followed them diligently up gravel tracks, but the place was nowhere to be seen. We re-read the guide description. We asked locals who pointed up in the right direction. We found a place but it appeared to be another vineyard, by this time we had done the gravel track three or four times. Wendy and Cassie went to investigate, they followed the loud music, I saw a person from outside, they knocked, entered and found no one. Returning minutes later like the place was empty but having a ghost rave. We gave up and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/p1130483.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well what do we do now? On the map a campsite was shown slightly south of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlovac&#34;&gt;Karlovac&lt;/a&gt;. They make the famous beer &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlovačko&#34;&gt;Karlovačko&lt;/a&gt;. We eventually found a cool campsite south of Karlovac in Duga Resa. They were busy, but had an excellent river to swim in and a reasonable restaurant, which suited us, given, we were by this time absolutely knackered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically we were surrounded by a very big group of Irish travellers headed for Bosnia, they had large caravans. Fairly modern. Towed by Transit vans. The group as a whole were making a lot of noise. The kids were climbing all over the bathrooms. We were worried we would be associated with them, so stayed well clear despite out close proximity. They looked dodgy, why would you travel in such a large group. I am guessing 30 in total?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Camping Costs: Autokamp Korana 171KN per night – 3 nights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Well…what a record, up and gone by 8.15hrs!!! Plus, Wendy went to pay for the night and made a complaint about being put on a pitch that wasn’t a pitch but a dog toilet! Well…they didn’t like this, but they still gave us a “discount”. We just wanted to leave this awful place. We decided to head for Plitvička Jezera. No GPS to navigate us, so we decided to just head for the motorway. It was a toll road but fast, so we just sat back and drove. We finally made our exit and headed for the lakes. We found a campsite and decided 3 nights was a good stop. We were fairly early, so set up camp, went looking for a shop to buy lunch and dinner for today from. Back to camp and we just chillaxed, as Dan and Cassie say. Cassie and Dan watched a movie on the laptop while Wendy lay in the sun reading. Ah! Great to relax. We did some washing of clothes and got wifi at the information centre. Here we also got information on the lakes and entry prices. Had a beer at the bar and then headed back for our braai for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9547.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;DAY 20: THURSDAY 18 AUGUST 2011&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Had a little lie in, but the heat of the sun coming over drove us out of our tents. We had a lazy breakfast and headed off to explore the lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;SHEESH!!! Talk about crowds! It was 11.30hrs and the car park was packed. We wondered over to the entrance and joined the extremely long queu for tickets. Dan managed to get student price by showing his University of Birmingham student card and Cassie being 6yrs old, was free! Actually, thats been a good thing about travelling through most of these countries, under 6yrs and you aren’t charged for them…BONUS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;So we followed the hoards into the national park, boy were there hoards. We made the choice to walk around and not catch the boat across the big lake. Once we got passed the point where everyone was boarding the boats, the crowds fizzled out and you could actually enjoy the walk. The walk took us 3½hrs and left the lakes at 15.00hrs. The lakes were beautiful. Crystal clear, you could see right down to the bottom of quite a few of them. Fish and ducks galore. We headed back to the supermarket for supplies. Back at camp, we lazed around and did a bit more washing etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;A little accident happened to us the night before, we had bought 2 bottles of olive oil, one for us and one as a gift. Dan got ours out to cook with and when he went to open it, the cork popped out like gun fire. He asked me to find the second bottle, but I couldn’t find it. Dan eventually found it, exploded in the toiletry and medical box! Needless to say, we spent the next hour or so cleaning olive oil off our medicines. Not a happy moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;That evening we took the computer to the bar and had a pivo whilst checking emails etc. Then we went back to camp and had another braai for dinner. We were going to head for the Barać caves just up the road tomorrow, then come back, do house keeping ready to leave early the next morning before the sun’s heat becomes unbearable in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9455.JPG&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9457.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9469.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9494.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9506.JPG&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9514.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;DAY 21: FRIDAY 19 AUGUST 2011&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Another lazy start with a leisurely breakfast. Dan and Cassie went to check emails whilst Wendy went to shower. All dressed, so off we set for the Barać caves. After a little navigating hiccup, we found our way there and set off for the tour. We were told by some nice Dutch couple that the caves were 9°C, we decided to brave it without a jumper. In a small group, with our guide, we headed up to the caves. Hard hat kitted out, we entered the cave and so the tour began. We were told that flashes on our cameras were not allowed, but people continued to use them and eventually our guide banned the use of cameras outright. We managed to get a few pictures though. And I didn’t use the flash I might add. Cave expedition over, and back to camp we headed. Again we did mundane house keeping – clothes washing etc. and then relaxed in the sun. That evening we packed up camp ready for an early rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9553.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9569.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Camping Costs: Camping Al Pez €26.80 – 1 night&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We were up, packed up and gone by 8.30hr! We had decided to miss out Venice as most of the campsites wanted a weeks booking, we only wanted to stay for 2 nights. Instead we were going to head for Northern italy, then using our already purchased Swiss Vignette to bomb through Switzerland and straight through France, using the fast motorways. We didn’t want to get stuck in expensive Austria or Switzerland again. Unfortunately we only had a large map of Italy to guide us. A day driving on toll roads, and as we left Croatia, we got stuck in a queu of Italian cars that were also leaving Croatia. We headed into Italy navigated by Wendy and maps. Needless to say, we took an incorrect exit and ended up in a horrendous traffic jam! Once through it, we found our way back onto the correct course. We finally beat all the traffic and navigational errors and found camping in a small mountain town. It was a no car next to tent camp, but the man let us camp in a field next to a motorhome. We noticed toilet paper in the spot we had to put our tent, so we decided to stay only one night. We put up our tent and then went in search of a beer. After being told that there wasn’t a bar, we wondered around and just happened upon a bar! We treated ourselves to an Italian beer. A pasta dinner and an early dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9577.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9578.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9580.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Camping Costs: Kamp Seget 191KN – 1 night&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We managed to leave early today, perhaps that was because we didn’t sleep due to the celebrations that consisted of loud music and singing. We reached Vela Luka at about 9.30hrs, purchased our tickets and went for a wonder around town. We had 4 hours to kill till the ferry. We managed to also find an exchange place that would exchange our Serbian Dinar! A relief as lots of places were simply saying no way. It was now simply a case of sitting and drinking coffee and waiting for the ferry. Oh and we are all covered in horse fly bites. We boarded the ferry and actually managed to get on first, meaning first off the ferry. We got our stuff together for the journey and made our way up to the saloon. We managed to find a table to sit at and here we stayed for the 2½ hr journey. Wendy got a little sea sick as she usually does on a ferry journey, so she wondered from occasion to help quell the sick feeling. Finally we pulled into split port and off we went. Dan was extremely excited to be first off the ferry. Off we headed for Trogir. We finally made it to Trogir and headed for the camp mentioned in the Bradt Guide. BOY! The traffic to cross the bridge into the little island Čiovo was awful…unfortunately this was where the camping was said to be so we sat in the queue. When we finally got to the campsite, they were full! We decided to carry on along the coast and see what we could find. We happened across a camp, and as it was getting late, decided to stay. Well, they put us next to the shower block where we swear fellow campers came to pooh their dogs. We assumed this as so many dog owners walked to where we were camped, stopped, stared and then walked away confused. Dan also swore blind that the place had fleas, so we deeted up, not wanting more bites. We went to take Cassie for a swim, the beach stank!! There was a motorhome toilet dump right at the entrance to the beach..you could see it as we sat and swam…disgusting!!! This was the straw that broke the camel’s back for us and so we opted to pack up early and leave. An early night, ready to skedaddle in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;Camping costs: Autokamp Vela Pelarka 99KN per night + 20KN electricity – 2 nights (7KN = €1)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Woken by the Call to Prayer, not heard that for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We went to see the Dervish house in Blagaj before setting off to Croatia. We went down and took a look, but they were busy doing conservation work to the house and rebuilding the surrounding houses around the dervish house. Cassie was amused as a dog followed us from the parking along to the path to the house, and it was waiting for us when we got back. The house seen, we had a coffee and planned our Croatia stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We decided to head for the island of Korčula, first seeing what the ferry prices were like. We got to Ploče with an hour till the ferry. It was 218KN (€13) for the ferry, so we paid and waited. We boarded the ferry to Trbanj. The ferry took 1 hour and then we headed for the ferry to Korčula at Orebič. The drive there was great, but we only had 30min to do it to catch the next ferry,and, we were stuck behind a coach! We made it to the ferry port, Wendy hopped out to run and buy ferry tickets. We just made it onto the 14.30hr sailing. From Korčula we headed for Lumbarda. The guide book said it had nice beaches and the map showed camping. We made Lumbarda in good time and found some ok camping amongst some olive trees. Mainly motorhomes, but still, a place to pitch the tents. We set up the tents, Wendy got pivo and then went in search of the beach for a deserved swim! Spent the rest of the afternoon swimming, then returned to camp for dinner. Need to wash more clothes in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Cassie’s Notes: When we got to Lumbarda we went to the beach. I had so much fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;DAY 17: MONDAY 15 AUGUST 2011&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We have arrived in Lumbarda during their national holiday/festival. We seem to be following the holidays. We decided to go into Korčula old town today. Cassie wants to see medieval places as that is her topic at school when she starts back in September. We had a wonder around, bought some souvenirs and went back to camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9305.JPG&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9312.JPG&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9322.JPG&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9339.JPG&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Dan popped across to the supermarket to get some lunch and Wendy did some more clothes washing. We wondered down to the beach again and spent a few hours paddling around. Cassie found half a goggle and Dan took it along with the camera and did a little bit of diving. He took some photos of sea urchins, sea cucumbers and some fish. The sea here is so beautifully clear. After a wonderful afternoon in the sea, we went back to camp to shower. We decided to go out for a bight to eat, perhaps taste the wonders of the local fishermen. The restaurant recommended to us was fully booked, so we tried somewhere else. The restaurant we found was great, the owners were bringing in the fish caught that day, gutting and finning them right there and then, ready for the evenings service. We saw a dish: lobster and spaghetti for 2. We decided to order it. The dish consisted of 2 lobsters, mussels and prawns in a lovely bisque sauce on a bed of spaghetti. Not only was it a tasty dish, but it was also a tasty price. We ordered spaghetti bolognaise, lobster and spaghetti for 2, a couple of beers and juice and it all came to 350KN, a fair €50! You would definately have paid well over £100 for this meal in the UK. Back to camp for an early night so we could break camp early to catch the ferry from Vela Luka to Split the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9354.JPG&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9357.JPG&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF9362.JPG&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;Camping Costs: Hotel/Pension Restoran Zmajevac €27 – 1 night&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We decided to head off into Serbia today but stop in a town called Ilik to see a castle and war memorial. We stopped for coffee which was very nice. Afterwards we headed off to Ilok. The town holds a memorial for the 1991 war. We first stopped at the Ovĉara Memorial which is the site of a mass grave. The towns people of Vukovar were massacred by the Serbs during the invasion. 200 people fled and hid in the local hospital. The Serb army found them and mass murdered them, burying them in a mass grave. Ovĉara is a memorial on the sight where they were found. The floor is set with with all the bullets found in the grave. A very humbling experience. From there we stopped at a vineyard, as Ilok is a wine region and had lunch. The wine was Traminac and was VERY nice, so we bought some. From here we headed to the Serbian border, where we waited to get Green Card Insurance. Here we waited, in the steaming sun, for 40 min or more. The insurance turned out to be €110 for 1 month. When the man finally returned with our insurance, we started our adventure into Serbia. We looked for road signs to Fruŝka Gora, but didn’t see any till we got into the industrial area of Novi Sad. Serbia looks very different to the other countries we have been in so far. A lot more rural even in the city. We stopped for money and to try use the GPS to help navigate us. Serbia uses a cryillic alphabet, it makes reading road signs etc. a lot harder. We found ourselves at the top of the road turning in the Fruŝka Gora park, but not having seen any signs for camping. We decided to carry on looking. We saw some people pitched on the side of the road in a caravan, but we were a little nervous of free camping. We managed to find a sign that said “sobe”, meaning rooms, and headed in that direction. We found a restaurant that also had rooms above it. The price was €27 for all of us, (Cassie stayed free), including breakfast. We decided to stay. We got out the maps and guide books and planned for where to go next. We decided to go and see the monasteries in the park and then head for another national park where they have a little railway you can go on. Mokra Gora, the line used to run all the way to Sarajevo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Camping Costs: Pension Basišiĉ 340.00 KN (Kuna) – 1 night (7KN = €1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;As we only had 1 tent to pack up, and we woke up earlier than our alarm, we managed to leave at a fairly decent time today. We didn’t have far to go according to the GPS so we had a nice drive. We had to purchase a Slovenian Vignette for the toll roads and then when we got to Croatia we had our first boarder crossing. The fantastic Hannah Montana GPS, routed us into the truck driver passport control!! If it wasn’t for some nice truck drivers letting us through, we probably would have been stuck there for a lot longer than normal. Passports were finally shown to stern looking Policemen. Once through border control we had to pay a toll. Wendy didn’t listen to Dan very well, and Dan wasn’t clear enough in his instructions to Wendy (I might point out that nerves might have been a little frayed), however, we lost €4 as the toll was only 68 cents and Wendy paid with a €5 note and got NO change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;So, we made it through the border, but had no local currency. Our next step was to find a bank. As we drove along, we saw countless birds of prey, Dan and I thought that they were falcons. They were all just sitting alongside the roadside on the fence. Cassie got very excited about seeing them. We finally arrived in Velika, but could not find the campsite that was marked on our map as well as on the tourist information board. We drove around, even attempted to ask a local. Eventually, we decided to head for a Pension we had previously seen. When we finally found it, we were lucky that there was a local man (circa 80 years old) at the Pension who spoke Australian English… and helped us with the Pension owner, who spoke no English. The same guy showed us to a local restaurant, it was very kind of him. We went back to the Pension to have a shower and then went back to the restaurant for dinner. Our phrase book was next to useless! Luckily, we brought along our guide book, that had a little phrase book at the end of the book that, fortunately, allowed us to be able to order us some dinner. Cassie had a pizza, Dan had a mixed grilled and Wendy had a grilled kebab. We went back to the Pension, and as we had to drive to the restaurant, we had a beer in our room. Cassie got her fix of T.V and watched something in Croat. Alarm set and to bed we went.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Planning the Summer 2011 Trip</title>
      <link>/2011/07/26/planning-the-summer-2011-trip/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2011 16:55:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2011/07/26/planning-the-summer-2011-trip/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;This Summer Dan has managed to wangle 4 weeks off work. To add to that, Wendy has changed jobs and now has the school holidays off, so she has 6 weeks holiday over the Summer! This has allowed us to open up our plans, expand our horizons and we have this year decided to travel down to the Serbia, Montenegro and the Bosnia area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;As usual we consulted our UNESCO World Heritage book for ideas of places to stop in the countries we would like to be visiting this year. We also bought Bradt travel guides for the same countries and started our “plan”, we only do this to amuse Wendy, Dan would rather just book the ferries point the Landy in the right direction and be done with it. Luckily the plans are never stuck too, not even the ferry bookings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We have a Michelin Europe Map (705), which is on a really large scale (1:3 000 000), which is great for planning our trips. It gets more and more tatty each year, not to mention colourful. So, we sat down with our trusty old Europe map and plotted places we found in book, on-line and in the guides. With help from a few glasses of Vino, this is what we came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/DSCF8029.JPG&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Once we had this plotted, we decided to draw up a Google map. Unfortunately Google won’t route you through Bosnia, so we have had to route around Bosnia to create our map. Pity really. We have shared this Google map with family so that they know the rough route we plan on travelling. We should really just say we are heading to Devon for a month, any mention of going further a field tends to instil panic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/assets/summer-2011-overview-map.jpg?w=640&#34; width=&#34;515&#34; height=&#34;371&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Between the plan’s inception and leaving there were a few things to sort out. When you leave the EU you need an international driving permit (IDP), we got this at a local post office in WHSmiths, what a bad experience! The cue was massive and the staff a bit unfamiliar. Next time I think we will use the AA postal service. Apart from the IDP, insurance is an issue. The EU 3rd party cover will not be valid in some countries out side Europe, like Serbia. We managed to confirm that a green card would be available on the border. Prices vary wildly thou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Over and above paper work, maps needed sorting, both paper 1:200 000 and GPS. The car needed a service and a couple of niggles sorting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Only 4 days to go and the car needs to be packed up by Thursday as Dan has a meeting Friday. The flat once again looks like a camping store with piles here and boxes there… Clothes are being washed ready to get packed up. Pity the English weather isn’t being helpful in the way of supplying sunshine. But it looks like all is going ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
