      <title>Upstand Corrosion Repair</title>

&lt;p&gt;I promised to do some posts about our planned trip, which we are due to depart on in 11 days. As of now we have not even booked the channel tunnel crossing or got our international driving permits. We are cutting it fine this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo shows some horrible corrosion I needed to get fixed before we go. It is in the area of the second row seat brackets on the upstand. Fairly typical of what happens when you combine steel and aluminium. Electrolytic corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I am in the throws of stripping the floor and getting the panel out. The end caps were particularly hard due to a hidden solid rivet under the c post bracket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New panels are from YRM, I got the upstanding and end brackets from them. I also have a galvanised crossmember I am not sure if I will fit that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to post more pictures as I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
