      <description>&lt;p&gt; If your planning on exploring the tracks around the Maritime Alps on the French / Italian border, you&amp;#039;ll need a few maps of the area. The best single retailer for maps in the UK is Stanford maps in London. They have three floors of travel books and maps. This is where I got our maps months prior to departing. Of course you can try online also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#039;t have to buy the maps before you leave, they are sold locally in France. You will need something with some detail though, equivalent to the UK Ordnance Survey (OS) map, which is 1:25k or 1:50k depending on the series you go for. In France the equivalent is the Institut Geographique National (IGN) they do a 1:25k map series which covers the whole of France. Where ever you go in France you can normally by IGN maps of the local area. So you could buy on arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the IGN maps, we also used the Italian equivalent as we found the IGN maps loose detail on shortly after the border. These maps are Istituto Geografico Centrale (IGC). At Stanfords they had these in 1:50k. They have a slightly vintage feel in the style of printing, but they are very clear. Interestingly they also show prohibited routes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I should also mention is that Garmin maps have a lot of the tracks we used, well certainly in the European City Navigator 2012. Not all though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-sep-2012-1320.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Here are some pictures of the maps we used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IGC 8 Alpi Marittime E Liguri (ISBN 9788896455081)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IGC 1 Valli Di Susi Chisone E Germanasca (ISBN 9788896455012)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IGN 3841 OT Vallée De La Roya, Vallée Des Merveilles, Parc National Du Mercantour (ISBN 3282113841030)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IGN 3741 ET Vallées De La Bévéra Et Des Paillons, Parc National Du Mercantour (ISBN 9782758524083)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Mount Jafferau and Lago Di Rochemolles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-1220.jpg&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125197.9639&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Track Up To Fort Jafferau &#34; width=&#34;417&#34; height=&#34;313&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After spending the night at &lt;a href=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/2012/08/23/fort-pramand-mount-pramand-overnight/&#34;&gt;Fort Pramond&lt;/a&gt;, we had a plan today to driver up to Mount Jafferau then on to a nearby Lake that is now a reservoir, we were hoping to spend the night by the river there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We managed to pack up fairly promptly and were on the way by the time the day was heating up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-0911.jpg&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125203.729&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Exit of the exciting tunnel&#34; width=&#34;368&#34; height=&#34;276&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;I was kind of excited about the day, because we were heading along a track that showed a cool tunnel on the map. I dunno how I came to that conclusion,  just by looking at the map. The tunnel on the track is circa 800 meters long, unlit, unpaved and leaks more than you would see in a normal road tunnel as it is not lined. This leak leads to a stream of water in the tunnel that is often a few inches deep. Oh and the end never seemed to appear, leading to a further sense of excitement under the dim light of the Landys head lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-1213.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125156.5093&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Fort Jafferau&#34; width=&#34;358&#34; height=&#34;268&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The other thing about the day that excited me was the climb to the Fort on Mount Jafferau, this sits at circa 2800 meters and promises spectacular views. We were not let down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Most of the track up to Jafferau is easy in a 4 x 4, I am not sure how far you&amp;#039;d want to go in a ordinary car. There are some fairly rocky sections, not hard but difficult in most cars. If the weather was bad, you would not consider it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;On the way up to Mount Jafferau, we were listening on the CB to other people that we could not see. We could hear that they were watching us, as they were mentioning the English vehicles. Even with the aid of the binoculars we could not see who was watching us and nor could we find them. It was rather creepy being in a valley, with all the ex military sites and the creepy night we had the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The track we were following stopped at Jafferau... Sort of. We had a plan to asses the situation at the end. This was because we had a map that showed a 500 meter foot path then the start of a new track down the other side of Mount Jafferau. Well when we got there we found that there was a track down, that was fairly steep and circa 1000m descent. Linking the track up and the track down was actually the easy bit. We did the whole descent in low range 1st gear, but had to occasionally slow the descent a little on top. It was great because we were following the Ski run literally, so naturally this led to us arriving at the top of the bubble lift and at the restaurant at the top of the lift. A convenient place to stop for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-1311.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125181.358&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Nice Lunch Stop&#34; width=&#34;368&#34; height=&#34;276&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Carole and Daniel had a double helping of home made Lasagne, made by the Owners Wife and Wendy and I had a local platter of meats and cheeses. After a good fill. We carried on our descent, we had about another thousand meters to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We headed down towards Bardonecchia to pick up the track to take us up to the Lake for the next night. Unfortunately we found the/a track but could not find our way onto the one we wanted that led to the lake. We ended up back tracking and taking a scenic road that met up with the track we needed. The track was really easy and fairly pleasant if busy. You could have done this section in a car. Apart from going to the actual camping spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-1546.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125152.4119&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;Valley of Lago di Rochemolles &#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;107&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The road continues on from where we camped to one of the highest glaciers you can drive to in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-1702.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125163.2832&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;Refreshing Bath&#34; width=&#34;341&#34; height=&#34;256&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We stopped for the evening at the river that feeds Lago di Rochemolles, it was obviously icy cold, but was great for a very invigorating bath and cooling some Prosecco. The valley was very scenic and a great stop for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-1704.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125195.692&#34; class=&#34;alignnone&#34; alt=&#34;Cutting Wood&#34; width=&#34;351&#34; height=&#34;263&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;That night we had a proper fire in a pit made by some predecessors, we managed to find enough wood nearby and an old sauce pan to warm water for washing up. Dinner that night was slightly left field. We had failed to stop for more supplies since our last supermarket stop, we had some powdered soup from Croatia. This was very nice, I think it was called Dalmation soup.... We also had three military ration packs, which had been given to us by John in Cinque terra. Our plan was to enjoy these as pudding after we had the roast potatoes. Unfortunately being military ration novices what we cooked for pudding was awful. I feel for the boys who eat them, this looked off. So we ended up going to bed a bit hungry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Update: I have since learnt that the packs last for 10 years. Sorry John. If you are reading this John, we lost your email address, hope you had a cool trip. It was great having a BBQ with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-2043.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125179.4502&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Girls Washing up.&#34; width=&#34;310&#34; height=&#34;233&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Camping by a stream led to a lot of night time pees. In the morning we woke stinking of smoke. Had breakfast and headed for the road. It was here, well in Bardonecchia we would say bye for a few days to Carole and Daniel. Obviously we did this over coffee and pastries. They were heading to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-23-aug-2012-17021.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1368379125165.5713&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;Our Spot&#34; width=&#34;363&#34; height=&#34;272&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We from hear ambled our way via a few one night stops home, as usual once we got half way up France the heavens opened and we just headed back to the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fort Pramand, Mount Pramand Overnight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-aug-2012-1825.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1366450394770.2654&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Fort Pramand&#34; width=&#34;388&#34; height=&#34;291&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Since leaving the Plitvička national park, in Croatia where we visited the former top secret airbase of &lt;a href=&#34;http://africanuhambo.co.uk/2012/08/16/zeljava-airbase-the-former-yugoslavias-most-secret-airfield-2/&#34;&gt;Zeljava&lt;/a&gt; we made our way to Fort Pramand, which was the next area we planned to do some off-road exploring, near Oulx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://africanuhambo.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/wpid-photo-18-aug-2012-1909.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; style=&#34;clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-18-aug-2012-1909.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1366450394854.0425&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Drinking Prosecco&#34; width=&#34;306&#34; height=&#34;229&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt; On the way we stopped in Slovenia at the Bovec national park to chill out for a day or so, around the beautiful mountains and river Soča, we seem to like that area and always have a good time exploring. We also stopped in Revine, which is near Connegliano in Italy, the area famous for Prosecco sparkling wine. We obviously had to grab a box from a vineyard. The main reason for stopping here though was to use it as a gateway to Venice. There is an intercity train that will take you straight into Venice main station. That&amp;#039;s another story though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After this we travelled towards Oulx, barring another one night stop at Lago Maggiore. Oulx is one of the nearest towns to where we had planned to head up to the tracks I had researched. So the original plan was to stock up with and food, water and beer we needed then go. Oulx has a few official camp sites in the immediate vicinity, should you need a base to explore from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;But the Landy had other ideas. I had noticed that on occasion with increasing frequency, that the battery voltage was creeping up to the point of potentially over charging the batteries. This was concerning, as apart from potentially screwing up my expensive new batteries it was likely to mean we could not depend on them when we were off the beaten track. Luckily when we stopped in Oulx, we had a fiddle with the alternator which was fairly new as I uprated it a few months earlier and found that some of the terminals must have either worked loose or built up a resistance on the regulator sensing connection. This obviously led to the regulator over exciting the alternator giving a high output voltage. It was interesting because none of the connections were noticeably loose. It has been fine since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-aug-2012-1448.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1366450394803.1416&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;On the up&#34; width=&#34;429&#34; height=&#34;322&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;So now the beer could be kept cool we headed up to the mountain tracks, via the main road that runs parallel to the E70 motorway, I think it is the ss n 24 headed east we took the left that leads up past Fort Fenils. However the excitement was not over! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;As we started to ascend we suddenly noticed a strong smell of smoke and soon came to some mountain fire trucks, police and lots of people. It was a forest fire approaching the road, we were lucky though they guided us past. The road is tarmac for a few kilometres on the way up before it turns to easy gravel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Next the Pajero which Carole and Daniel were driving started to overheat! So we had to stop shortly after hitting gravel for lunch. Luckily to get to Fort Pramand we did not have far to go so, time was on our side. You&amp;#039;d think that was the end of the drama though surely. Luckily the next incident started as we approached the fort. The Pajero decided that the automatic transmission oil indicator would light, suggesting it was overheating. We guessed it was because of the low range work and slow speed, not helped probably by the earlier overheat. Oh well it would get a chance to cool overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-aug-2012-1629.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1366450394765.179&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Tracks up&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The tracks up to Fort Pramand are easy, until you get to the last bit leading up to the Fort, which is a turn off from the main track anyhow. The track narrows because of trees either side that lean towards the center of the track. The ground has a few large roots to climb. It is not to bad in a small or low 4x4, but with the root tent on the Landy it was a little tricky, we clipped a corner of the tent lightly. Just a scuff mark no damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The Fort itself is fairly big, but in a very poor state of repair it sits at 2162 meters, there are various warnings spray painted on the walls warning of Danger. The roof is in a poor state of repair. I suspect it has had a few vehicles on its roof. You can walk onto it by following the track up, the view is excellent from the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-aug-2012-1746.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1366450394771.471&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Dinner&#34; width=&#34;356&#34; height=&#34;475&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Once we settled up there and started to cook and set ourselves up for the night it started to feel a bit spooky. The girls were convinced it was haunted. Especially when something took exception to Wendy&amp;#039;s singing. For some reason after we all told her not to quit her day job, and that she did no justice to Black Betty, the radio in the car came on and started blaring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We had a nice dinner which was made even better with the red wine we got from Connegliano to season it. Shortly after the clouds rolled in so we disappeared for what we thought would be a peaceful night. However with the girls convinced we were being watched by spooky ghosts, Wendy woke a few times to noises, saying she felt like someone was climbing the ladder to the roof tent. She then woke me up because she was too scared to go to the toilet! The conversation went along the lines of.... &#34;Do you need a pee. no. Can you come with me. Do I have too. Yes. Well I am not going twice get Cassie, we&amp;#039;ll have a family pee.&#34; Needless to say. There was no ghost waiting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-22-aug-2012-1754.jpg?w=500&#34; id=&#34;blogsy-1366450394800.108&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Setup&#34; width=&#34;366&#34; height=&#34;275&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;With hind sight I guess being parked with the ladder right against the Fort, between two very dark portals was probably adding to the girls apprehension. In the morning Carole got out of the tent having had no sleep, because she was also convinced ghost soldiers were marching across their tent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After breakfast we left a little tired and headed for Mount Jafferau, via a cool tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;If you want to download the GPS track from this post and the next you can download it here at &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=3261982&#34;&gt;Wikiloc&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=1741579&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;Everytrail&#34;&gt;Everytrail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7889158964_c853f3ebe0.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;DC-3 abandoned&#34; width=&#34;427&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The main reason for heading up to the Plitvička National Park again, was not this time to visit those beautiful lake, which bring most tourists to the area. My research for interesting things to see on our travels, had caused me to stumble  upon the abandoned airbase at Zeljava. Some of which is on the Croatian side, the rest spans the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Having seen the lakes and tourist crowds a year ago, we decided to fore go the experience again. We planned the day such that the bio-in-laws, would disappear in the morning to the lakes, Cassie was desperate to join them so went to show them around. Then if they returned in time they would join Wendy and Myself to visit Zeljava to try and find the base. As it goes they did return and three of us disappeared to find the base. Cassie stayed at camp with Carole. We had spent the morning tidying up the car and catching up on what would be best described as administrative tasks. Oh, I also spent the morning superglue&amp;#039;ing the rear indicator lens back together, from two million pieces in the grass...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/76486608@N05/7889406454/in/set-72157631307007120&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; style=&#34;clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7889406454_5ea4028caf_c.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;209&#34; height=&#34;279&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;From our campsite across the valley we could see mount Plitvička and mount Gola which hid Zeljava from us, the summit is home to modern radio masts, probably cellular these days. Being over looked by this helped build up the anticipation for me, we had been longing to do something different since Mont Saccarel in Italy. We did not manage to get to the top of the hill to explore, although I had a gps track to find our way. I believe during the period that the base was in use, the mountain over the airbase housed a radar warning system which was part of a network for Yugoslavia, this formed a early warning system for the airspace around Yugoslavia similar to NORAD. Regardless of what was now at the top, it would have been nice to explore, and it probably would have provided great views of the base, back to the camp and also over Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/76486608@N05/7889398448/in/set-72157631307007120&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; style=&#34;clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7889398448_71685d1284.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; height=&#34;270&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;On the net there is a lot of interest around military bases and sites, Zeljava is no different. It did not take long to establish it&amp;#039;s location months before we departed the UK. I used google earth to verify and then generated a waypoint for the GPS. As I also had 1:200k maps of the area from our last visit, I drew a box around the area and highlighted it so I could find it during the trip. Before we departed the UK, I had been to Stanford Maps in London looking for more detailed maps, I would have preferred 1:50k or 1:25k, but they had nothing better than I had. I also had a look on the Internet for a source but was not successful, I don&amp;#039;t know if such detailed maps are produced for the area? Perhaps not for walkers, I guess the land mine risk is still very real, I expect military maps do exist thou, in fact I have seen extracts of Military maps, so am sure they exist. If you know a source please leave a comment or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/76486608@N05/7889447928/in/set-72157631307007120&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; style=&#34;margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7889447928_c316a60bd3.jpg&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;429&#34; height=&#34;322&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/76486608@N05/7889451114/in/set-72157631307007120&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; style=&#34;clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7889451114_d4300e011a.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;357&#34; height=&#34;268&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Getting to the Plitvička area had been a great drive the previous day, although it was slow. I set the GPS to go via a couple of minor towns along the border area, and also set it to minor and un-paved roads, avoiding highways and major roads. Oh how the route impressed us, we went through tiny habitations and along mostly single carrage roads were the Tarmac barely remained. One section saw us follow about 20 km along a gravel route to a lake, I think the people there before us had stayed the night, it was a watering hole for a horse trek also. Had we been on our own I think we would have stayed the night. At the exit of this track we took the oppurtunity to stop at a sign that said &#34;Med&#34;, which is honey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/76486608@N05/7889430760/in/set-72157631307007120&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; style=&#34;clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7889430760_9c19261aeb.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;321&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The locals sell their honey, local plum brandy known as Rijeka and often wine, being tourists, they took the oppurtunity to sell us the golden delight at a much inflated rate, not speaking Croation meant we had little choice, but to  either except or move on. Needless to say we choose the former, two gigantic jars of Honey for 150 Kuna. Working out the price I have no idea how we got to it, when we did not understand the man, he just shouted louder! Our indications to write it in the dirt got lost in translation. Oh well we leave richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/76486608@N05/7889428454/in/set-72157631307007120&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; style=&#34;clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7889428454_84d179df0a.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;370&#34; height=&#34;277&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Later on the route took us along routes that over looked Bosnia and Herzegovina, where we could see old border walls from the conflict, deserted habitations and bullet ridden houses, signs for mines are still a fairly common sight and leave otherwise beautiful land abandoned. Croatia has always struck me as a country of contrast, in respect to redevelopment post conflict. The coast is very built up and apparently affluent, were as if you head inland, there are still areas were buildings are derelict and bare the bullet scares of the war. The people on the coast are mostly involved in some way with tourism, the people inland are hard working farmers and manual workers. They look honest and interesting, I wish I could converse with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Thanks to the net there is a lot of information available about the history of the base. It&amp;#039;s construction was started around 1948, at the time it was known as Objekat 505. The actual pooring of the concrete is in some of the info I read is supposed to have started a few year later in the 50&amp;#039;s. Construction was finished around 1968. On completion it was given the name &#34;Klek&#34; and had a military post cost of 4868, to reflect the start and finish years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The design of the base is such that the tunnels are semicircular, and big enough to allow fighter jets to enter, the tunnels are about two jets wide. When the tunnels were constructed they had positions for explosives to be placed, such that detonation would cause the facility to become unusable. The entrance to the tunnel is shaped to allow the tail of the aircraft to enter the tunnel like an upside down &#34;T&#34;shape, these could be blocked by 1 meter thick pressurised doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The internal sections of the base are designed to withstand a 20 kilo-tonne nuclear bomb. Which I have read is equivalent to the nagashima bomb, in Japan during world war two. As you would expect being able to withstand such a blast would imply that the doors would have to be kept shut. The base internally had generators, fuel storage, waste storage and water. The most important facilities were all located in the tunnels, with a mess room capable of seating 1000 people. Fuel was piped from storage tanks located 10 to 20 km away in a mountain in Bosnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Above the main tunnels in the mountain, accessed by elevator only from inside the tunnels, was a room that was used for strategic planning and by the operators of the early warning radar system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The base was in use until the 1990&amp;#039;s and at one stage was looked at with a view to modernisation around the late 1970&amp;#039;s. When it was first built it is said to have cost some where between 4 and 6 billion US dollars. Apparently the funding came from the world bank and was secured for development of communication routes (motorways and roads) in the former Yugoslavia. The construction was carried out by a Serbian firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;In the end, during the conflict it was the Yugoslav Peoples Army (JNA) who detonated the pre-prepared explosives for distruction of the base on there retreat. I guess the base would have been rather useful to advancing forces. Later there was further distraction of the base using 56 tonnes of explosives, by the military of Serbian Krajina, this was carried out in 1995. Articles on the web site locals as saying that the force shock local towns like an earth quake and that the tunnels smoked for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/76486608@N05/7889025612/in/set-72157631310217932&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; style=&#34;clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7889025612_623531420e_c.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;External to the tunnels there are five runways on the base three lead straight into tunnels. The last two were used for other aircraft to land. The total area I&amp;#039;d the base was on the order of 9km by 4km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Ordinarily staff at the base lived in the town of Bihać, which is in Bosnia now, this was the nearest city. I have read on one site that there was a dedicated bus service between Bihać and the base for staff to commute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Visit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Croatian side of the airbase comming from the Plitvička national park there is only really one way to get to the base by road. In order to this your arrival is via the small village of Zeljava, which seemed almost empty save for a few dozen people who live in the houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the village and the base are various buildings that appear to be abandoned almost deralict in some cases. Shortly after the village on the main road on the left you pass gates, behind which it is possible to glimpse an old military plane. It is possible to see how cars have avoided the closed gates and damaged fence, to make there own path to the road behind the gates. Where it eventually leads who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued past the planes to the find the rest of the base, about 1 kilometre further, we came across what was our first sign of more to be seen. Buildings hidden on the right by trees, this time of the year the dense trees and shrubs provide good cover for the buildings and relics hidden around the base. We cut off the main approach road, to explore what appear to be vehicle maintenance or facility areas. We abandoned the car at this stage choosing instead to explore by foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeding towards the runway areas south east from where we were brought us via vehicle inspection ramps to another open area, that we were not sure of the use of, but it was littered with hydraulic hoses and metal scraps, there were various bullet ridden sign posts and behind the trees, what looked like a discarded bomb, that was not / had not detonated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We continued towards the end of what was runway 4 and runway 3, which meet at the what looks like an apron, prior to the entrances to the tunnels 1 &amp;amp; 2. Turning right, past another mine warning, the open apron gives way to the approach to the tunnels, which was almost claustrophobic with the tree cover that was slowly reclaiming the base, making it feel close. As you approach the tunnel entrance you feel that there is something watching you. All the time listening to rustling and noises in the trees,never being able to identify what the source was. Eventually we knew we were close by the wall of cold air that hit us, emerging from the tunnels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Shortly before the tunnel entrance we noticed a strange metal object that although half complete looks like a soldier or guards metal hat. The tunnel mouth although visible is obscured on the lower half by a mount of dirt that has been placed to prevent people taking vehicles into the tunnels. Entrance by foot is possible, having no torches or breathing equipment we choose to avoid this option on this occasion, instead staring into the dim light. We chose to avoid entrance because of a report I had read warning of toxic chemicals in the dust and potentially radio active waste from the fire detection equipment that was unaccounted for. Appart from this entry is fairly hazardous due to the unstable nature, but probably would not have prevented us if we had not been fortunate enough to read the report (available in the site links below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After this we went on to explore tunnel entrance two, but were interrupted by the sudden noise of several 4x4&amp;#039;s at first we were unsure of the nature of these vehicles, as I had previously read of border police being sensitive in this area, probably because of the unguarded border to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Luckily the vehicles turned out to be civilians tourists. With this we recovered our vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned back with the vehicle to explore the remaining section beyond the apron towards the unmanned Bosnian border, along the approach we passed various buildings for fire and parking areas. In one area, we came across the remains of a military vehicle minus the chassis and engine on its side. This looked like it had been hit by something, judging by the holes in the body. Not sure what it was used for thou. Along the road we came across spent bullet shells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We proceeded further to the border, where we came across an eyry owl, that was remarkably tame. Was this some kind of sinister warning? After taking some film we stopped at the UN border barrier for some photos, before making our way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way out we wanted to look at the abandoned aircraft near the base entrance. These turned out to be a DC-3 and two F-84 fighters, I was not able to work out the exact type. But they proved an interesting addition to the visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;References / More Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found most of the info I wanted by following links out of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDeljava_Air_Base&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia Zeljava Airbase&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zeljava-lybi.com/Zeljava-index2_eng.html&#34;&gt;Zeljava Lybi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antignano, Livorno - Italy</title>

      <guid>https://africanuhambo.co.uk/2012/08/06/antignano-livorno-italy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/dscf9256.jpg?w=300&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-818 alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Poor Tusky&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Carole and Daniel have decided that they would like to look for a small camping fridge. We looked for a Decathlon and used the GPS find our way. It was along the way and we were heading towards Bari now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We found a Decathlon, but were not in luck, they did not stock any fridges what-so-ever! As we were near the shops, we decided to stop off and get our food shopping done for the next few days. As we were packing the cars and fridge with our food shop, Dan and Daniel noticed an oil leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;It turns out that the vacuum pump is seriously leaking. We need to get to a garage and get the right part to fix this situation. Dan used the GPS to locate the nearest Land Rover garage, and off we set on a search for this garage and a way to get the part we would require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The first garage we find is no longer open to business. This is a set back that we did not expect or want. The day is wearing on and time is ticking. We managed to locate another Land Rover garage, and so the search continues. This time we are in luck! The garage is still in business, but we have now hit Siesta time and so we have to wait for 14.00hrs till we can find out if they have a part or can order one for us. We decide to go to a truck café we saw just down the road to have a snack and drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;When we get back to the garage, the guy is extremely helpful. He says that he can order the part, but it may take as long as 48hrs to be delivered. Give him an hour or so and he will see what he can do for us. It turns out that he is able to get the part delivered for the next day, we just have to collect it after 14.00hrs. We thank him profusely and set off to find a campsite that isn&amp;#039;t too far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The campsite we found was just up the road. It had a swimming pool, points for Cassie, and it had bungalows, points for Carole. Carole and Daniel rented a bungalow and we took a pitch. We decided to stay for 2 nights so that Dan had time to fit the pump and not worry. As we pulled up to our pitch, Dan got worried about being able to work on the Landy. It wasn&amp;#039;t a secluded spot. We went and had a look at a pitch that we would be able to &amp;#039;upgrade&amp;#039; to if we wanted. It was more expensive and came with it&amp;#039;s own sea view terrace. Dan was happier with the privacy this pitch provided, and so we moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/dscf9240.jpg?w=225&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-817&#34; alt=&#34;The terrace adjoined to our pitch&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The time at he campsite was spent relaxing. The next day Wendy and Cassie spent the day at the pool whilst Dan worked on the Landy and Carole and Daniel did things they wanted to catch up on. It was a nice lazy stop despite the reason for stopping. We explored the beach, went for a swim in the sea and had a lovely braai on the terrace on the last evening. Ready to leave in the morning and do one mammoth drive. We were going to try and cover the whole distance to Bari tomorrow, making up for lost time.&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/dscf91791.jpg?w=300&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-810 alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Crossing the River Arno towards the Tower&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;It was a rather later start to our day than we had expected, with the knock on affect of us arriving in Pisa at midday. As we searched for a parking space, the temperature signs showed that it was already 40°C ... it was going to be a scorcher! We parked on the outskirts and walked, following the signs for Torre Pendante.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;As we drew nearer to the Tower, the crowds were building and so were the amount of restaurants and tourist shops. We soon found ourselves looking for a space where we could take that typical Leaning Tower of Pisa shot. Each of us assumed the pose, and so our &amp;#039;holding up the Tower&amp;#039; pictures were immortalised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/dscf9189.jpg?w=225&#34; class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-804&#34; alt=&#34;Wendy &amp;#039;holding&amp;#039; up the Tower&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The heat and the crowds were now slowly taking their toll on us, so we decided to not spend any more time than we had to, and leave. As it was so unbearably hot, we decided to stop at a café and have a long, cold drink to see us on the rest of the way back to the car. Here we decided that Lucca would be a nice place to stop, Dan had heard from a friend that the Old Town was a lovely place to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Sated from our cool drink, we melted our way along back to the cars and headed off out into Lucca. It was lunch time when we pulled up outside the Old Town walls. We grabbed our lunch, the picnic blanket and a drink and sat under a tree to eat. There was a tourist office across the road, and so we paid it a visit to find the nearest campsite. It was just up the road a bit, so we hoped back in the cars and went in search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The campsite was more geared for motor homes, but they had a large field where tents were able to pitch. Carole and Daniel had to pitch their tents there, whilst we had a motor home spot, just opposite the field. Cassie was in luck, there was a swimming pool. Tents pitched, costumes on, it was off to the pool to cool off after a stinker of a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Carole and Cassie decided to stay at the pool, whilst Daniel, Dan and I wanted to head off into the Old Town for a little bit of an explore. It was a little trek into the Old Town, but we stopped off at a bar just inside the walls for a refreshing beer. We then spent the next couple of hours wondering around and admiring the cobbled street, beautifully decorated front doors and churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/dscf92031.jpg?w=225&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-807 alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Statue of Puccini&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Back to camp for a spatch-cocked chicken on the braai and a nice early night. It&amp;#039;s time we started to head off in the direction of Bari to catch the ferry across to Croatia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Levanto, Cinque Terre - Italy</title>
      <link>https://africanuhambo.co.uk/2012/08/04/levanto-cinque-terre-italy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7871688232_f83515ef75.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; alt=&#34;Windy road&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Another winding journey down off the mountain this morning. We stopped in a small, sleepy town and had the best coffee we have had so far on this holiday. From here, we decided to drive along the coast and make our way to Cinque Terre National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The drive along the coast was lovely. We did not have far to travel, but as usual, the coastal roads proved to be slow going. We stopped at a restaurant and enjoyed a lunch of grilled fish, mussels and spaghetti. We decided that from here, we would make our way up onto the motorway for the last, short leg of the journey and miss all the coastal traffic, so we could have some beach time of our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We arrived in the town of Levanto, where the GPS advised there was a campsite. There was one, and they had space. We got to our pitch, set up the tents and went in search of the local beach. There were many beaches where you had to pay for entry, so we headed to the free part of the beach. We found an empty patch of sand, and proceeded towards the water for a lovely, well deserved swim. The water was lovely, and after a shingle entry into the water, there was a sand bank further out where we could stand and relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7875031658_992a54aed9.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;414&#34; height=&#34;309&#34; alt=&#34;Levanto beach&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After a refreshing swim, we headed to the beach bar next door where we ordered a couple beers and a spritz. We sat and chatted here for awhile, enjoying relaxing on the seaside. We decided we would go from here and find a nice restaurant for dinner, as we had not brought anything to cook dinner with that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;There was a free concert happening in the square that evening, and after mulching around, we decided to try a restaurant close by. We had a lovely meal of seafood again, and sampled some lovely local wine. The menu was, again, in English as well as all the other major European languages, which took the mystery of menu deciphering out of the picture. But, all the same, it was a fantastic meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7875017550_596d33e82d.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;436&#34; height=&#34;327&#34; alt=&#34;Enjoying the local seafood&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;From here we went across the road to a bar for another beer. A bit of a late night, but we are spending 2 nights here, so there is a lovely day of rest tomorrow for us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The day started out with a nice lie in. No rushing, did some clothes washing, had breakfast and showers, then decided to head into the town. Daniel needed some swimming shorts. Cassie decided she wanted to stay with Carole and Daniel, so we left them to their search and headed off in another direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Dan and I bought our obligatory, touristy tea towel from a rather jam packed, &amp;#039;a little bit of everything&amp;#039; shop. On our perusal through the town, we came across a small market on one of the side streets. Here I found a stall selling handmade leather handbags. I chose a green one, and my wonderful husband bought it for me as an anniversary gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We left the quiet back streets and went in search of Cassie, Carole and Daniel. We found them sitting in a restaurant waiting for their lunch. Dan and I were not that hungry, so we went for a short stroll after buying a gelato each. The road we strolled down was very touristy and had nothing but souvenir/beach tat. We headed back for the others at the restaurant. Cassie had a gelato for pudding, but unfortunately, both Cassie and I had had chocolate, it was very rich, we both soon started feeling ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7874995172_f4326588cd_c.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;302&#34; height=&#34;403&#34; alt=&#34;Mmm gelato&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We all headed for the supermarket to gather supplies for dinner, and then headed back to camp for a swift change into our beach wear, and headed straight down to the beach. Dan took Cassie&amp;#039;s snorkel and mask and went out for a dive. Daniel and Cassie stayed in the water and Carole and I sat on the beach and read our books. A lovely afternoon relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;From the beach, we headed out in search for a beer. We found a bar just up the road, where we ordered a beer and watched in amusement as an Italian Metal band started setting up for what appeared to be a concert they would be giving that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;What we soon discovered was that, when ordering a few beers, after a certain time in Italy, you receive some tapas (or Italian equivalent, what is it called?). This was a nice and welcomed accompaniment to our afternoon beverages. Thus we seemed to have a few more beers here than we would usually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7874979240_eef3e297d0_c.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;321&#34; height=&#34;428&#34; alt=&#34;Enjoying the atmosphere at the bar&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Back at camp we grabbed a communal Braai and braai&amp;#039;d some sausages for &amp;#039;hot dogs&amp;#039;. Dan and Daniel invited up an Englishman they&amp;#039;d been chatting to, also staying in the campsite. His name was John, and he had just left the army after his 22 years in service. He was spending some time travelling and relaxing before starting a job in London. He was good company and he brought us a gift of ration packs. Very thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After a lovely evening of beer and good company, we headed off to bed. Off again in the morning, making our way towards Bari and the overnight ferry to Croatia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Col Linaire, Col de Sanson, Pas de Colle Ardente - Mount Saccarel</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7871723104_817a4bd793.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;The next track&#34; width=&#34;376&#34; height=&#34;282&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After finishing up on Col de Tende we headed back down to the town of Tende for supplies and to freshen up at the local piscine (swimming pool) (If only they had known!), before we departed for the second section of our little off road trip. Again we planned to stay at least one night up on the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;The local chap at the fuel station we met the day before, had been correct about Col de la Boaïra being block from the Fort Central end, so we decided to heed his advice again and took his recommended entry point to the next pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;With a plan in place, we kicked off by heading south from Tende fully refreshed and clean towards St Dalmas de Tende, where we turned left to head east on the D43 past La Brigue. This took us to the turning for the D143 on the right that allowed us to get to what would be the start of our next off road excursion at Notre-Dame des Fontaines. Apparently this is worth a stop to have a look, we did not take the opportunity unfortunately but will next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We headed straight up towards Col Linaire, which would take us up through the forest &#34;Bois Du Pinet&#34; along what seemed considerably more dusty gravel tracks than the day before. On the way up we passed an old Willis Jeep heading down, the driver, his dog and Family looked local and to be having a great time. I guess the old Williss is ideal for adhoc dog walking on your local mountain. What an awesome playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Given the time we left Tende after our swim and restock, it was not long, probably 8 km from the church until we decided we would stop for a light lunch. We stopped at a 5 point junction that offered to easily get us lost. Luckily it was easy to work out the exit we needed, after removing the closed piste and the exit we arrived from! The junction on the map is at &#34;Cime du Pinet&#34;, which is the Top of the Pinet hill. There were various logs lying around for us to sit on to enjoy lunch. There must be a certain amount of forestry undertaken, perhaps to control the fire risk? While we were there another car was parked up with a local who had just gone mountain biking, he did not seem so friendly thou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7871721608_6d3de535d8.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Forest Roads&#34; width=&#34;334&#34; height=&#34;250&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After having lunch we continued up the fourth exit... Towards Col du Loup, this continued through the Forêt Communale de la Brigue it was great driving through the forests, they provided a welcome break from the heat. As we were driving up, I was conscious that although we had enough water to last us easily for at least two nights, we did not have a lot spare, so was keeping an eye open for a source that would allow is to fill the solar shower and water carrier. At this time of the year there did not seem to be many streams around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7871715168_50ec94991d_c.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Topping up with water&#34; width=&#34;227&#34; height=&#34;302&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Luckily we happened upon a water trough that was reasonably full. The water looked clean enough for the intended purposes and had a steady flow into it, which meant it was not stagnant. We filled up the shower and most of the carrier. But it was a slow process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-2-aug-2012-14236.jpg?w=500&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Border marker&#34; width=&#34;339&#34; height=&#34;254&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;After getting water, our final re-supply item we continued up to the border area to Col de Sanson / Baisse de Sanson. The next section hugs what I think is the 1947 border of France and Italy, it was fairly spectacular along the ridge or the south east side of Mont de Colle Ardente for the first 5 km or so, then the track pops over the top for the next roughly 6 km along the north west side of Mont Saccarel, I think this is Pas de colle Ardente or part of. This leads into Pas du Tanarel which will have you emerge on the eastern side of Mont Tanarel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-2-aug-2012-15323.jpg?w=500&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Track to Mont Saccarel &#34; width=&#34;322&#34; height=&#34;242&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;It is about 2 km south of this point you have the option to proceed down towards San Bernardo and off the mountain or as we did proceed towards Mont Saccarel which is at 2200 meters. Mont Saccarels&amp;#039; summit overlooks a 12 meter statue of Jesus, that was placed there is 1901. The statue has a fantastic view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;That night we stayed on Mont Saccarel, just below the summit which had the remains of some old fortifications. When we arrived at the summit there were some local Italians having a braai, that had driven up in there 4x4&amp;#039;s. We parked above them on the summit and decided to walk to have a look at the statue, it was about 1 km walk and would allow us time to see what the local chaps did. As it goes they disappeared shortly after we started our stroll. So after taking some photos of us and the Jesus statue we wondered back and pitch camp where they had been. Our camp straddled the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-2-aug-2012-17542.jpg&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;View from the summit&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-2-aug-2012-16451.jpg?w=500&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;Jesus Statue&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-2-aug-2012-1646.jpg?w=500&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;Group shot&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;That evening we used some of the water we collected on the way up, to boil up some pasta and washing up water, no one had the trotts in the morning so needless to say the water was fine. We had a hearty vegetable pasta dish for dinner followed by beer! The rest of the evening was spent admiring the changing view in the evening light and listening to the distant cattle grazing it&amp;#039;s way across the slopes below. Once the sun had gone down we went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;During the night I got up to look at the stars (have a pee) which were almost blinding due to the lack of light pollution, in the distance far below us there was the orange clusters of street lights in local towns and villages. I spent a few minutes admiring until the cold got to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;In the morning, we woke to a definite chill as you&amp;#039;d expect from a clear night at that height, the morning was glorious and I could not wait to see the view first from inside the warm shelter of the tent, then while I enjoyed the warmth of a warm fresh coffee. There was a problem though, I first had to go for a climb!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;During the night we had visitors... My flip flop had gone for a walk, only one. So armed with one of Wendy&amp;#039;s on my once bare foot, I dug out the binoculars and eventually far below I spotted the outline of my black flip flop in the rocks and shrubs. Off I trekked to get it, shortly after I put the kettle on. On recovery of my flop, I was suspicious, apart from some sizeable teeth marks, there was also a fairly stinky deposit of what I think was pee. I suspect a fox or something decided to mark it&amp;#039;s territory on my flop flip. I promptly returned to camp to deal with the situation, both proud and puzzled. By this time the kettle was boiling and with my now clean flop, we enjoyed our coffee and I pondered the curious event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;My flip flops will live another summer by the looks of things, I guess the wife&amp;#039;s did not smell nice enough for our visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/wpid-photo-3-aug-2012-0659.jpg?w=500&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Solar shower&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;Having fed ourselves and packed up, we freshened up under the solar shower, the moon had little effect on it&amp;#039;s temperature thou, so it was rather refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;We then headed down the track we arrived on before turning off down the mountain towards San Bernardo for a coffee, before we headed for Cinque Terre our next stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have uploaded the GPS track, if you would like to get a copy please click &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B3lq5J_TSkjFNXBiaFM5VFBnSmM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;Gps track&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From St Jean D&#39;Aulps we were heading for Tende in Italy, but we couldn&#39;t make it in one go, so we decided to drive as far as we could manage and then stop for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our drive took us past the Mont Blanc glacier and through the Mont Blanc tunnel. The tunnel fare was a tad steep at €38.90! When we got through to the other side, we got some photos of the glacier.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright&#34; src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7873944696_1750263a48.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mont Blanc Glacier&#34; width=&#34;397&#34; height=&#34;297&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made the decision to stay on toll roads to try make headway. We finally decided to stop in a small town called Barolo. The campsite was small and lovely. They served spritz at the camp bar, we bought some to serve as a refreshment whilst putting up tents. This was the start of a beautiful relationship between Carole and the spritz..one that I put money on would last well beyond this holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7873965772_dcbdd26649_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Great food and wine&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tents were in a sleep-able state, off we trotted to the local restaurant for dinner. What a find! We decided to go for the taster menu, where we were given an assortment of dishes from their menu. With this we tried some wine fro the local vineyard, we had a lovely bottle of red wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright&#34; src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7873970924_f776b77436.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ready for my dinner!&#34; width=&#34;349&#34; height=&#34;262&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t want to stay out too late as we were heading into the mountains tomorrow for a good few days of offloading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chez Wardie &amp; Lancie - St Jean D&#39;Aulps</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt; We took the mountain roads to St Jean D&amp;#039;Aulps. We had informed Anna that we were coming, but due to the incident in Paris, we were early by a day. We decided to stop in Taninges for lunch before arriving at there&amp;#039;s late afternoon. We had a lovely pizza in a sleepy pizzeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7862343290_daa6316b71_c.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignnone&#34; alt=&#34;View from bridge in Taninges&#34; width=&#34;217&#34; height=&#34;290&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we had a warm welcome from Anna and Lance. It&amp;#039;s been awhile since we have managed to get together so it was good to see them again. They had friends staying, so Carole and Daniel were given the other spare room and Cassie, Dan and I slept in the roof tent out in the garden. The guys had a great time chatting all things technical as Dan set the tent up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7862351588_bd1795dfc0.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;Tent set up&#34; width=&#34;368&#34; height=&#34;276&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had gone to the supermarket on the way to Anna and Lance&amp;#039;s and gotten bits and pieces for dinner. We&amp;#039;d decided to fire up the Braai. Anna had outdone herself this year and had a magnificent veggie patch. Cassie and her raided the veggies to make us an assortment of fabulous salads to accompany our dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7862347748_f4fef7fa68_c.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Anna &amp;amp; Cassie with their veg patch spoils&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next day we decided to go into Les Gets to take the cable car up to Mont Cheri and then the chair lift to the very top. Carole is not good with heights, so she decided to stay at the bottom and wait for us. We bought our tickets and made our way to the cable car, bidding Carole a farewell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable car journey up was uneventful, we sat and watched mountain bikers come down the mountain and Daniel recorded the journey up on his video camera. From there we hopped onto the chair lift. I was a tad nervous as I&amp;#039;ve never been on a chair lift before. It was a white knuckle experience for me. About a 3rd of the way up, Daniel went to put the strap of his camera case over his head and knocked his glasses off...we watched them slowly fall to the ground under the chair lift. Silly Billy! We&amp;#039;d have to go back and look for them on the way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7862371672_8a9e03015d.jpg&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;White knuckles!&#34; width=&#34;382&#34; height=&#34;286&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view from the top was magnificent. We took our touristy, scenic photos and then decided to walk down, instead of catching the chair lift down. The walk down was beautiful and we found some carvings made out of tree stumps, all of elves/gnomes. Daniel walked down on a mission, leaving us in his dust, he was on a mission to go and try find his glasses. As the rest of us got back to the bottom, Dan went off to help Daniel find his glasses. Cassie and I went and had a nice cold drink, whilst we sat and watched the 2 Dans look for the sunglasses. Dan suddenly shouted jubilantly, he had found them!! Meanwhile Daniel was almost at the top looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7862372918_ec7903e4ae_c.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;What a view&#34; width=&#34;356&#34; height=&#34;475&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down we went to find Carole and go back to Anna and Lance&amp;#039;s. We had also been advised to go to Lac Montriond where there was a beach where Cassie could go for a paddle. The ladies spent a lovely day down at the lake paddling and reading, whilst the 2 Dans spent the afternoon fishing. They managed to catch a few tiddlers, nothing of an eatable size. Never the less, they had a good afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retired back to Chez Anna to have another lovely meal round the table of braaied lamb and fresh veggie patch salads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bade a fond farewell to our lovely hosts, we were heading off into Italy for some offloading adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer 2012: Calais to St Jean D&#39;Aulps - Leg 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt; Dan woke on our departure morning with unusual pre-trip nerves. We packed the vehicles and headed for a pre journey tea and cake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our European journey started out with us managing to get onto the Chunnel earlier than expected. The excitement was building, with boarding looming for what we hoped would be another Summer Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear:both;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://africanuhambo.co.uk/assets/7862486536_94dd931b1d.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;405&#34; height=&#34;304&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first night was uneventful, having booked ourselves into the Formula 1 (motel) at Abbeville. We pulled in, checked in and found a restaurant just a hop and a skip down the road. Had a pleasant first meal. Formula 1&amp;#039;s are basic: simple room, separate showers + an ok nights sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were abruptly woken early the next morning by some snotty, screaming children running up and down the hallways...not happy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made an early start, we are now heading for Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we arrived at the Premiere Class (similar to the Formula 1) we were booked into, we decided to check in and then take the lift to go and check out our rooms before heading off for some food. Our rooms were on the 3rd floor and as the lift came to the 3rd floor, it stopped! The lift would not go up or down or open the doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 6 adults and Cassie in the lift, and it was HOT, HOT, HOT! We had little air circulation and four 50 watt halogen bulbs burning down on us. Clearly it was going to get hotter. Dan made the decision to remove all but one of the bulbs, to minimise the heat build up. Being so hot already and not wanting to burn himself he removed his soaking shirt to handle the bulbs. In the end we were stuck in the lift for over 45mins. Cassie had to sit on the cramp floor to avoid fainting. She also started to have a mild panic attack, we had to quickly calm her down. We were all dripping after 10 minutes. If it had not been for a French speaking man in the lift with us, that had his mobile phone with him, we probably would have been stuck in that lift for a LOT longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff at the hotel simply did nothing about us being stuck in the lift, choosing to stay in reception instead, despite the knowledge we were stuck with an infant, no one from the hotel staff attended to provide assurance they were aware of our problem or that someone would attend imminently. We had to call the maintenance company ourselves and then the fire brigade to chivvy them along. Eventually we were set free. We were now rather hot, angry and irrational. We headed downstairs to speak to the receptionist to get a refund and leave. To put it bluntly, the receptionist simply did not give a damn. As he said to us &#34;it is not a problem, only a small one&#34;. We were told that we had to wait till 15.00hrs for the Manager before anything could be sorted out....so outside to the car we went to sit and wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manager arrived and we went in to speak to her about a refund. The conversation got a little heated and the Manager decided it would be better if the police were around, so called the Gendamerie. So we waited for the Police to arrive, during the wait the Manager would not talk calmly to us to sort the matter out. Another hotel Manager had since arrived, she kindly translated and spoke to the Manager for us. She agreed with us and our situation and seemed appalled that the Manager would not listen or give a refund. The Police arrived, they spoke to the Manager and then called Dan into another room to speak to him, and simply agreed with Dan that the Manager was out of order, and allowed us to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Police arrived, the manager was suddenly cooperative and listened to what we had to say. Her argument was that there we&amp;#039;re too many people in the lift. We argued that we had called the fire brigade for help as her receptionist would not help, and there would be a recorded call with the operator that said we had 6 adults and 1 child in the lift. Anyway, after a long, heated debate, we decided to cut our losses and leave Paris, head to St Jean D&amp;#039;Aulps, to Dan&amp;#039;s sister and brother in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found a campsite on the outskirts of Paris, a Euro Disney visitors campsite it would appear, and stayed 1 night. The campsite scored Cassie points as it had a swimming pool. Short stay, with no more events to be noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next day we broke camp a little to late. We drove as far a Dijon and managed to find a campsite in Dijon. We managed our first shopping trip and had a lovely Braai of spatch-cock chicken and potatoes. Did some clothes washing and sorted out our travel plans to get to Anna and Lance the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another late break from camp, hopefully we will get better at this as we go on. Looking forward to a break from driving.&lt;/p&gt;
