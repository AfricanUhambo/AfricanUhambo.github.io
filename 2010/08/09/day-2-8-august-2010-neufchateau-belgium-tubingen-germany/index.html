			<h4 style="text-align:justify;">Camping costs: €53.00 – 2 nights</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As soon as we had packed up and hit the road, the wet set in and continued to stay wet right the way across into Germany. A day for border crossings, wonder what it would have been like if we had had to go through the customs as we went into France, Luxembourg, Germany, France again and back into Germany to reach Tübingen. We are meeting up with Pete in Tübingen at the camp site there on the River Nekar. Just before we got to Tübingen we stopped at a services for lunch…big mistake as it cost us €17.30 for 2 sandwiches, wurst, 3 drinks, biscuits and a chocolate. Seems a lot, but it really wasn’t for that price! We decided to go on the toll road between Saarbrucken and Strasbourg to cover some ground, this however meant a toll of €6.10. The day finally brightened up as we reached Tübingen. Perhaps it was the paying of a toll that brightened up the day..our fee for the sunshine. We finally managed to find the camp site and Pete was waiting for us at reception when we drove in. Pete had managed to bag himself a campervan/motorhome plot however the camp refused to let us have the one next to him and we had to go to the tent area. What was annoying was that you couldn’t take your car into the tent area. We managed to find a spot right next to the hedge and park the landy there so we didn’t end up having a walk whenever we needed something.We put the tent up and went to the bar for a well earned beer. After having a refuel at the bar, we took Cassie for a walk along the river to a small park where she could have a play and burn off some energy. We had all decided to have dinner at the camp restaurant as we had not managed to stop at a shop to get supplies. We had Swabian Dishes, meaning local. They consisted of a ravioli filled pasta with a potato and sauerkraut accompaniment.</p>

<h3>DAY 3: 9 AUGUST</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today was our 2nd Wedding Anniversary. We had ordered bread at the camp store for the morning, and when this was delivered the next day, we had breakfast and went for a walk into the Old Town along the river. Once in town we found a café and had a coffee. Pretty pricey town as 3 coffees and a juice cost €13.00. Guess you are paying for the architecture you are seeing whilst drinking your coffee.</p>
<p>                      <img alt="" src="/assets/P1080353.JPG" width="150" height="200" /> <img alt="" src="/assets/P1080364.JPG" width="150" height="200" /> <img alt="" src="/assets/P1080373.JPG" width="150" height="200" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="/assets/P1080380.JPG" width="200" height="150" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We wondered around trying to find a supermarket to get things for lunch and dinner. After asking in very broken German, we managed to decipher that there was no supermarket in town and had to go out of town to find one. Well that wasn’t on the agenda, so back we trudged to find smaller stores to get individual items. We got bread from a baker and spotted a store with lovely salamis etc. in the window. Well! €41.74 later we had lunch! I think the sausages were made from pigs that ate gold. A beer was needed after that to wash away the shock. Poor Cas got attacked by wasps because she was drinking Fanta. We ended up trapping them in the ashtrays whilst she drank her drink. Back to camp to eat our expensive lunch. It was a bit of a hot day and there happened to be an outside swimming pool across the river from where the camp was. We decided to take Cassie and go cool off. The slight down side was that the bridge to cross the river was a good 10 minute walk down the river and then back up the other side to the pool. The pools were great. There were 3 different pools and they had slides, which Cassie loved. After a cool off, we wondered back to camp for dinner. After seeing the prices in the town, we decided to eat at the camp restaurant again. This time for dinner, we had pork with Swabian noodles and a salad. It was very nice, but there were far to many noodles on the plate and to be honest, they were very bland. Whilst having dinner we discussed the route we were taking. We couldn’t make it all the way to Bovec, Slovakia in one day, so a stop overnight was required. Austria was settled on for this stop.</p>
